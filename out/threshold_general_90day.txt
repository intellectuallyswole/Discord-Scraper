BegYourPudding		To help others spot scams, this one has you create an account (I used a relay email address) and then enter a promo code. That unlocks your "reward". They said I'd won 0.47 BTC.

However, to withdraw the "BTC", you have to deposit 0.01 BTC. You do that, and you've lost that 0.01 BTC when they run away with it (and your "prize").

It was a very convincing website, but the brand had no footprint on the internet.

I was thinking that if they were essentially loaned the tokens (from the DAO) for like a 2 or 3 year period and when the period is up they pay the original tokens back to the DAO interest free and they keep the rewards they‚Äôve earned to continue their participation.  Would the mechanics of something like this even work and if not can someone help me reinvent a staking program for Threshold?  If this would work maybe we would accept applications for a month or two and get in touch with universities we think could be good candidates and then use our governance process to select a limited number of universities.

derek		I assume you mean your staking duration is set to end around the merge. 

Up to you; there are existing contractually locked stakes that will need to use the staking adapter for some time. Either way you will still be able to upgrade to T at the (eventual) fixed conversion factor once the merger happens, whether your stake expires early on without extending your duration or your stake expires after extending your duration (cc <@!412679128316379137> )

Basically if you have an existing stake in NU with StakingEscrow, or the equivalent on the KEEP side, those stakes will be considered as stakes on the Threshold network by the relevant staking contract as if they were staking in T; the (eventual) fixed conversion factors for NU -> T and KEEP -> T will be used in the backgrounds to assess what the equivalent stake value in T would be.

Xkoyopa		How many Nu/Keep nodes are currently in operation? 
Estimated # of T nodes at launch?
khanny123		No worries thank you :)
Xkoyopa		At initial launch, wrapping only.
derek		There will be staking adapters that allow existing NU and KEEP stakes to stake in Threshold as if they were staking the equivalent amount of T. For those with liquid NU or KEEP, the vending machine smart contract can be used to wrap those tokens to upgrade to T.
khanny123		Guys so quick question, in order to get the T token can you only get it by wrapping either Nu or Keep into T? Or can you buy T with fiat

R0bb0		not sure what country you're in but where i come from that is absolutely not the case. any swap (even wrapping eth) is a taxable event
wood gundy		*the transactions occur on an exchange
wood gundy		There are no taxable events in crypto unless they occur on an exchange.
R0bb0		great, thanks for answering.
derek		> so if we're a current Nu staker, and we stake in Threshold, we'll never actually directly receive a new token therefore no taxable event until we withdraw our T?
Your stake will remain in NU, but you will receive staking rewards in T

> and is there any circumstance under which this would dis/advantage the staker or will it always work out equal to, for example, swapping your Nu stack for T and staking T directly? 
Once the merger occurs, the conversion factor of NU -> T will be fixed. That fixed conversion factor will be used by the Threshold staking contract to calculate what the value of the legacy NU stake is in T, and then any relevant/subsequent calculations (eg. rewards etc.) are based on that value
R0bb0		so if we're a current Nu staker, and we stake in Threshold, we'll never actually directly receive a new token therefore no taxable event *until* we withdraw our T?

jakelynch		think the lesson from uniswap was dont give it to ivy leagues lol
maclane		it's possible, yes. i think it would be good to flesh out what the goals for the network would be as part of this program. evaluating some of the uniswap governance delegations to universities would also be worth investigating since there's been some drama around that
sloop johnb		This is actually a really good idea.  Getting University and research participants could germinate additional interest in Threshold Network .   I would think that based on reserve T that performing a grant to interested participants that it should lent out with the tokens owned by Threshold Foundation and the staking rewards being kept by the University.
derek		There have been two efforts that have significantly helped with high commitment costs due to gas:
1. The period duration was extended from 1-day to 7-days so commits were only needed once every 7 days instead of every day. This makes your commitment costs 1/7th of what they were previously (<https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/periods.html#day-period>)
2. Ursula can control the maximum gas price used for commit transactions via the `--mas-gas-price` configuration option (<https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/support/faq.html#q-how-does-my-worker-node-choose-what-price-to-use-for-transactions-can-i-control-this>). Now that nodes have 7-days between periods to make a commitment, this option is very useful due to the fluctuation in gas prices over those 7 days. There is the caveat that since you would be capping the gas price, if gas prices remain higher than your cap over the 7 days your node may not successfully make a commitment before the end of the period - so you need to monitor it and potentially raise it if necessary (near the end of the period without a commitment)

Your commitments should not cost $200.

Xkoyopa		How many Nu/Keep nodes are currently in operation? 
Estimated # of T nodes at launch?
khanny123		No worries thank you :)
Xkoyopa		At initial launch, wrapping only.
derek		There will be staking adapters that allow existing NU and KEEP stakes to stake in Threshold as if they were staking the equivalent amount of T. For those with liquid NU or KEEP, the vending machine smart contract can be used to wrap those tokens to upgrade to T.
khanny123		Guys so quick question, in order to get the T token can you only get it by wrapping either Nu or Keep into T? Or can you buy T with fiat
Xkoyopa		
Evandro Saturnino		Threshold network is the protocol being built by Keep and Nucypher teams. According to the current time-line, if everything goes as expected, the merger contract which will allow to upgrade KEEP and NU tokens to T tokens will be deployed in December.
coder		u starting a T network? what is it? btc gate to defi , right?

coder		hello, new here
invisible		Has the process for opting in for existing nodes been solidified?  Is it part of the vending. Been digging around looking for a concrete path/answer.

willthesis		Hello hello. I recommend joining the threshold marketing guild! Head over to <#882289615959121990> and react with the correct emoji for access to the channel. The guild also has a quick sync tomorrow as per <#899020401718493285>
0x49Fe		Hello everyone, am happy to be here.
 Am from East Africa, passionate about growing a strong blockchain community in our country, am kindly inquiring if keep network could support keep local meetups in our region.
maclane		audits are unrelated to the uni staking program other than that we have a good relationship with Ronghui and team üôÇ
maclane		no idea, but i doubt it
Xkoyopa		Was the CertiK audit of T network carried out from Columbia University grounds?
Xkoyopa		It will be interesting to see what comes of this. The Universities will be able to analyze the world's 1st crypto protocol merger in a live research setting.The entire team and networks are making history. It's a really amazing accomplishment. ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°
maclane		I assume they will want to opt-in to Threshold like other stakers since NU emissions are halting
student		Without entering into a discussion of price, I am hoping for some clarity about the initial total supply and circulating supply of T; in my reading, the initial total supply of T will be 10b. The total supply of Keep is ~1b (with ~600m in circulating supply) which after the token factor of 4.5 will account for 4.5b T. The total supply of Nu is ~1.35b (with ~700m in circulating supply) which after  token factor of ~3.8 accounts for ~5.1b T. Together these account for ~9.6b T. Is this how the token factors were determined (after the arbitrary 10b total supply of T was voted upon). If so, and again without getting into a discussion of price, do we have a sense of what the initial circulating supply of T will be? Will it be the entire 10b even though the circulating supplies of Keep and Nu are ~50% their total supplies? I just dont have a strong sense of the difference between total supply and circulating supply and how these relate
DenisKrivilev		Hello everyone <a:emoji_26:912200997458305045>
deneme / "the gloves are off"		It‚Äôs basically first cry of newborn network? So we celebrate our new healthy child.
deneme / "the gloves are off"		Is it today (T contract deployment)?
Xkoyopa		What is the significance of the contract deployment (I know it's a stupid question...lol)
Srinath		Okay thanks for clarifying.
maclane		Could be referring to token contract deployment, which doesn‚Äôt mean liquid tokens
Ryan C		looks like scam... no TGE scheudled for the 27
Srinath		https://twitter.com/Coinkoio/status/1462682876479098885?s=20
Srinath		Is today TGE date for T network ?
Evandro Saturnino		We don't have any information about that yet, this will be up on the exchanges, they could facilitate the way for upgrading the tokens to T or it could be that you will need to follow the wrapping process everyone else follows, by doing it outside the exchange.
BegYourPudding		Is there any news on when T will be on an exchange / which exchange?
Xkoyopa		And where will the contract be available?
Evandro Saturnino		No need to be a staker for you to be able to do that
Evandro Saturnino		No, anyone who hold KEEP or NU tokens will be able to interact with the wrapping contract, to wrap their tokens and upgrade it to T tokens
Xkoyopa		So when the vending machine becomes active, only stakers can wrap nu/keep to t?
derek		Just wanted to point out that the `mas-gas-price` is a powerful tool and isn't a "set it and forget it" type of tool - gas prices are volatile and the max-gas-price would need to be periodically adjusted accordingly if you want to ensure you commit every period

> my question was about the rumor of an amnesty on longer stakes... 
It's something that we are exploring but still TBD - <https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/899663279062921257>
East		One more thing, the whole wrapping/unwrapping will occur on the Threshold site which will interact on your behalf with the vending machine contract (https://github.com/threshold-network/solidity-contracts/blob/main/contracts/vending/VendingMachine.sol).
invisible		And whether anyone could comment on that
invisible		I agree. They shouldn't. Yet several time that's exactly what it was asking for...last week ended up being 96$ They're 10x what they were like a month or two ago. Max gas was what caused the issue I was talking about bc if you don't make a commit due to high gas that unlock date gets pushed further and further out.  I wasn't intending on the high gas prices to be the topic... my question was about the rumor of an amnesty on longer stakes...
Evandro Saturnino		Threshold protocol will offer an adapter that will enable the user to keep staking NU or KEEP and receive T tokens as rewards. **However ** It's not possible to determine right now if the CEX exchanges will support the users on this. So this will depend entirely on the CEX side.
Xkoyopa		So basically you would need to unstake,then wrap your nu to T in uniswsp?
East		Wrapping isn‚Äôt live yet, so nothing you need to do at the moment, instructions on how to upgrade and whether you need to proactively do anything onchain will be shared around when the contracts go live. It‚Äôs up to Cex like Coinlist to support this process.
geugent		I have nu stacked in coinlist. How to have T?
MrsNuBooty		Bro be respectful of our community moderators‚Ä¶. They bust us all day and night.
R0bb0		i was referring to the mechanics. "so if we're a current Nu staker, and we stake in Threshold, we'll never actually directly receive a new token therefore no taxable event"

no need to be the internet police bro üòâ
kudo94		tax legislation is individual in each country and is not related to the T project
R0bb0		where exactly would it be on topic to discuss the tax implications of the NU/T staking/swap mechanism sir?
R0bb0		please... we all have to off ramp. and all of the on ramps/off ramps have been commandeered by the government. unless you mined the eth you locked up for the worklock, they know you have it and they know what you did with it.

unless i plan to move countries, swaps are taxable events üòâ
kudo94		Guys, this is off-topic)
wood gundy		So you have volunteered your wallet keys to the government?
R0bb0		not sure what country you're in but where i come from that is absolutely not the case. any swap (even wrapping eth) is a taxable event
wood gundy		*the transactions occur on an exchange
wood gundy		There are no taxable events in crypto unless they occur on an exchange.
R0bb0		great, thanks for answering.
derek		> so if we're a current Nu staker, and we stake in Threshold, we'll never actually directly receive a new token therefore no taxable event until we withdraw our T?
Your stake will remain in NU, but you will receive staking rewards in T

> and is there any circumstance under which this would dis/advantage the staker or will it always work out equal to, for example, swapping your Nu stack for T and staking T directly? 
Once the merger occurs, the conversion factor of NU -> T will be fixed. That fixed conversion factor will be used by the Threshold staking contract to calculate what the value of the legacy NU stake is in T, and then any relevant/subsequent calculations (eg. rewards etc.) are based on that value
R0bb0		so if we're a current Nu staker, and we stake in Threshold, we'll never actually directly receive a new token therefore no taxable event *until* we withdraw our T?

and is there any circumstance under which this would dis/advantage the staker or will it always work out equal to, for example, swapping your Nu stack for T and staking T directly?
AlphaWOLF		Lfg...stoked af for T
MrsNuBooty		Integrations Guild Hangout is starting now!
jakelynch		stem schools only
jakelynch		think the lesson from uniswap was dont give it to ivy leagues lol
maclane		it's possible, yes. i think it would be good to flesh out what the goals for the network would be as part of this program. evaluating some of the uniswap governance delegations to universities would also be worth investigating since there's been some drama around that
sloop johnb		This is actually a really good idea.  Getting University and research participants could germinate additional interest in Threshold Network .   I would think that based on reserve T that performing a grant to interested participants that it should lent out with the tokens owned by Threshold Foundation and the staking rewards being kept by the University.
derek		There have been two efforts that have significantly helped with high commitment costs due to gas:
1. The period duration was extended from 1-day to 7-days so commits were only needed once every 7 days instead of every day. This makes your commitment costs 1/7th of what they were previously (<https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/periods.html#day-period>)
2. Ursula can control the maximum gas price used for commit transactions via the `--mas-gas-price` configuration option (<https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/support/faq.html#q-how-does-my-worker-node-choose-what-price-to-use-for-transactions-can-i-control-this>). Now that nodes have 7-days between periods to make a commitment, this option is very useful due to the fluctuation in gas prices over those 7 days. There is the caveat that since you would be capping the gas price, if gas prices remain higher than your cap over the 7 days your node may not successfully make a commitment before the end of the period - so you need to monitor it and potentially raise it if necessary (near the end of the period without a commitment)

Your commitments should not cost $200.

Minh Tran		do we have officially token factor for Nu and Keep to T ?
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		They said stay tuned to their news/blog page for updates
llyrios		With coinlist supporting T, does that mean after wrapping we can store and buy/sell it there? Obviously I understand that may not be right away
JP		Lol, they‚Äôre getting pretty brazen
Naxsun		I assume you mean your hww? If so, depending on the type ofc, I expect you can connect to to the wrapping tool like you for example can now connect to the Keep dashboard with your ledger or trezor. More details tba
Naxsun		This is the latest timeline. https://medium.com/@keep_project/a-provisional-timeline-for-the-threshold-merger-7593d5cb3771
Naxsun		The token factor for NU will be 3 point something. The exact token factor will be determined once the network inflation is suspended. NU Token Factor = 4.5B / Token supply NU
Naxsun		Each NU and KEEP tokens can be wrapped to T. The amount of T received is the amount of NU * the token factor
Naxsun		This is referring to the token factor
tejaposh		Also, if i have NU in my Cold wallet, can i convert to T?

kudo94		Heyüëã
Naxsun		There is still KEEP and NU that is locked / unvested. The tokens can not be transferred, hence can also not be wrapped. The team explained there will be adapters for these cases that do allow to stake on the Threshold network (adapter will convert KEEP or NU stake to stakeweight in T using the token factor)
Naxsun		Then there's 1B, 10%, which is the treasury of the Threshold DAO
Naxsun		So from wrapping there will be a maximum of 9B tokens
Naxsun		The token factors will be determined such that the total supply of KEEP, if all wrapped, results in 4.5B T tokens. The total supply of NU, if all wrapped, results in 4.5B T tokens
Naxsun		So 4.5 and 3.8 are not official numbers. In general 3.8 seems off. It's 4.5 B / supply
Naxsun		Hey, one correction to be made here. The token factors are not frozen yet. These will be determined once inflation on the existing networks is suspended. All numbers up to then are just predictions
student		Without entering into a discussion of price, I am hoping for some clarity about the initial total supply and circulating supply of T; in my reading, the initial total supply of T will be 10b. The total supply of Keep is ~1b (with ~600m in circulating supply) which after the token factor of 4.5 will account for 4.5b T. The total supply of Nu is ~1.35b (with ~700m in circulating supply) which after  token factor of ~3.8 accounts for ~5.1b T. Together these account for ~9.6b T.

If so, and again without getting into a discussion of price, do we have a sense of what the initial circulating supply of T will be?

willthesis		Lfg. Too stoked for full DAO. Guilds are just the start
willthesis		Definitely. Let us know if you have other q's in the meantime. If you keep the og wrapped T tokens staked and only sell the T you are earning for staking that is one way to differentiate
nico186		thanks Wil, I pulled mine from the dash board a while back, but want to help out however I can, So excited for the launch!!
JW		Thanks. I look forward to better understanding. I can imagine a scenario where I have wrapped tokens earning Treshold tokens, and wish to sell the original t tokens and maintain the keep/nu for nostalgic value or whatever.  Being able to differentiate for a market sell is important in that intance.
willthesis		Current snapshot is just for stakers. We are shifting towards more inclusion in governance for all token holders with the DAO
willthesis		There will be guides for that too. Realistically there isn't much of a difference except that you can only unwrap with the total amount you originally wrapped with
nico186		Good Morning Everyone! sorry for the basic question... I currently have my KEEP in a cold wallet (not Staked) am I able to vote on the proposal?
JW		I will be equally interested in understanding how to unwrap, if I ever wish to. Also, if wrapped and staked how to differentiate between wrapped tokens and original threshold tokens.
Monregi		I'm sure there will be no problem wrapping the tokens, but it also seems like an unknown area where also with the guidelines there may be mistakes made by inexperienced users. I include myself that I have some eth in the coinbase BEP20 limbo
willthesis		The upgrade is opt-in so that choice is yours. However, when the time comes - there will be detailed guides and we will be here to help with the wrap process
Nella		I am afraid to start experimenting with wrapping so I am just keeping my NU and Keep on Coinbase.
willthesis		On the Keep side it is stakers

Xkoyopa		Community Snapshots for Threshold Network-Level Emergency Security Developer Multisig (ESDM) Proposal

@everyone A new proposal for establishing an Emergency Security Developer Multisig (ESDM) in the Threshold Network was just created in the NuCypher Snapshot space and the Keep Snapshot space, starting in 30 minutes from now and going over 7 days.

TL;DR: The ESDM is a 3-of-4 multisig formed by NuCypher & Keep dev teams and serves as a security mechanism that allows quick reaction to security incidents or critical bugs affecting Threshold's Staking contract. Full proposal and discussion: 
https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-network-level-emergency-security-developer-multisig-proposal/110

Two options in this proposal: 
1. Yes, I support the ESDM proposal
2. No, I don't support the ESDM proposal

Â§©‰ΩøÂú£Áéã		Is anyone here?
Â§©‰ΩøÂú£Áéã		When will the NU currency skyrocket?
Naxsun		There are also still locked tokens that can not be wrapped until unlocked. So these would go from locked to unlocked (added to circ supply), and then potentially / likely wrapped
Naxsun		Yeah in essence the circulating supply
Bobooshka		So the supply of NU and KEEP will trend lower forever as people trade their wrapped T

BegYourPudding		Can I still vote in the DAO if I have to in the pool?
kylekjr		Ok perfect thank you!
maclane		Stopping NU inflation requires an on-chain DAO vote, stopping KEEP inflation is done via their multisig council.
kylekjr		Can someone please explain what the difference between freezing the rest of Keep and stopping NU inflation?
East		Keep the Keep in your wallet for the decentralized T wrapping process . And you can put them to work in the meanwhile in the Coverage Pool or in the Eth/Keep Pool. You can take your time with wrapping.
Xkoyopa		Regarding T launch, what is considered the official launch of T network? Is it when the vending machine goes live and wrapping is possible or is there some other technicality that defines the official launch?
maclane		maybe you are thinking of coinlist? a community member reached out to them and apparently got a response that they will be supporting T
maclane		sushiswap, uniswap, curve, etc are all decentralized exchanges. no one needs to accept or approve anything. anyone can launch a pool

RoadtoErehwon		Merry Christmas Michael! - have a mince pie for me

maclane		got it, i think the old whitepapers are fine in that case. maybe with a note that they don't necessarily reflect the current evolution of the network
Xkoyopa		Right, we are just working on a FAQ sheet and that is one of the questions
maclane		I think more relevant/up-to-date are the various blog posts, documentation, and cdebases themselves
maclane		That‚Äôs possible,  it they are both a bit dated. Many of the ideas are similar but the design evolved over the years as it was implemented.
Xkoyopa		Asking for marketing guild, should we refer people to the existing whitepapers for nu and keep?
Chrispy		Sometimes it‚Äôs good to just take a break from looking at daily market prices and realize that all these markets run in cycles and if you continue to hold you‚Äôll be just fine.
NU4lyf		ape together strong
Chrispy		My advice is to enjoy the holidays. Whether nu/keep was at .65 or $1.5 really is irrelevant if you‚Äôre waiting to see what happens with T launching and entering exchanges with an active marketing plan.

(Treasury DAO?)

Xkoyopa		Where will the staking guide be made available? 
Specific location
-websites?
-forums?
Asking for marketing guild FAQ sheet.
maclane		It‚Äôs sort of open to interpretation. Some might say when the token contract is deployed, others when the vending machine is activated and liquid T is in the wild, others when the DAO contracts are live on-chain, others when staking contracts are activated. I think there‚Äôs even an argument to be made that it‚Äôs already launched given how active the Threshold DAO already is thanks to the great work of the <@&905818990927028296> <@&908829318866669598>

Isin		yes, cause NU is in inflation now. once the inflation stops, the conversion is fixed. and then it comes to ~3.3.
CHOOPMANSNU		I trust it, as of today. But it seems to change for some reason? I‚Äôd just like to understand what I‚Äôm buying and how that affects conversion at the date T is launched, because some reason my Nu is now worth less T than when I was told to buy it..
Isin		the number is correct. ~3.3T per NU, 4.5T per KEEP. Trust the math , sir.
CHOOPMANSNU		Hi sorry if this is a stupid question, newb here but trying to understand the conversion calculation. How is the Nu/Keep conversion ratio calculated? I am seeing lots of numbers ranging from 3.3-3.7 T for every Nu and ~4.5 T for every Keep, I understand ‚Äú45%‚Äù is distributed to both networks, but I‚Äôm not following the math here. If someone could dumb it down via actual step-calculation that would be super helpful
Mic		sorry but i am not understanding. If I stake keep in coverage pool, is there a chance I can lose some of my KEEP?
kudo94		hey, T will have its own network, the Nu network will develop further, both tokens (KEEP and Nu) will continue to exist
TheSerb		Been a bit out of the loop üò≥
TheSerb		Hello everyone, what exactly happens to the Nucypher privacy layer upon the merger occurring? Does Nucyphers network still continue functioning except it uses T instead NU? In such a case, I‚Äôd assume NU tokens wouldn‚Äôt have any utility?
Chizzle90		Not being being hostile but if everyone reads like 10 questions prior to asking a question these guys wouldn‚Äôt have to answer the same question every 5 questions.  Just a secession so these guys can work.
Agoristen		At least that's what I'd consider "the merge" - vending machine deployment.
Agoristen		If things go according to the plan, it will happen somewhere between December 30th 2021 and Jan 1st 2022.
Anonymouse		Hello guys, when will happen the merge?

Paden3d		So something I just read from <@!414604822616997899>  made me wonder...I know what happens if I wrap current NU or Keep holdings into T but can NU or KEEP I get my hands on in 6 months still be wrapped the same? I understand it would be at the day one wrapping rate. Sounds like I need to brush up my math skills to decide if future KEEP or NU procurements would be worth getting and wrapping or not.
maclane		No, it‚Äôs a Brazilian neo bank
Rume		what is nu bank, is it related to $nu
Rume		it looks like better to hold keep then if I need more T.
Rume		yes so starting from then to....whenever
maclane		Or any time after
Rume		OK so 30-31st DECEMBER. I can change it to T?
maclane		The relevant date for upgrading is the vending machine activation
Rume		so T will launch in a week, then I can convert my Nu and Keep to T
Rume		based on chart it will be done between 18 to 20 december
maclane		It‚Äôs not possible for NU and KEEP to dissolve since they are both immutable erc20 token contracts. Instead, they can be used to upgrade to T
maclane		The latest timeline is here https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/918665346913820683
Rume		when is T launch and when can we start converting our Nu and Keep to T? Does that also mean Nu and Keep will dissolve.
maclane		The initial T supply is split equally between both networks. 50% NU, 50% KEEP. The communities mutually agreed to set aside price, since it‚Äôs too easy to manipulate the short/medium term prices and we didn‚Äôt want to create a bad incentive for each side versus the other. The prices have flippened each other multiple times since then anyway
Matt Luongo		Because this was decided by the community months ago based on supply so that price wouldn't make a difference. Doing it the other way is pretty unpalatable if you think about the consequences
Matt Luongo		It's the Discord of Keep and NuCypher, merging into the Threshold network
ÎÅùÌåêÎåÄÏû• | FINALBOSS		Why is the ratio of $NU switching to t lower when $NU`s current price is higher than $KEEP?
zop1997		Can threshold be marketed as using quantum resistant cryptography? This would be a big differentiator and allows us to take a leadership position in this important area.
East		Yes. They‚Äôre well explained in the dashboard. You‚Äôre basically an underwriter, buyer of last resort, in certain situations.
Mic		is there any risk of staking KEEP in coverage pool?
BegYourPudding		Anyone?
Mic		is this KEEP discord?
Matt Luongo		We've had this for over a year now but only used it internally... think it's marketable? Called "sortition pools"
OhmaGa		If you plan on sticking around for Threshold and your holdings are liquid id suggest converting them to keep as you will get more T
Jun888king		Thank you for your answer.üôèüôèüôè
maclane		There is no problem
Nevergiveup		Keep it simple, what's happening with NU?
Jun888king		Then, I would like to know if there is no problem in converting it after T launch even if the staking is locked for 42 days from the 15th of this month on the coinlist. Thank you for your answer.
BegYourPudding		QQ: does wrapping cost gas fees? I'm just checking if I need my wallet loaded with ETH to wrap my KEEP into T later this month
aristogeiton		i know chainlink was working on this a while back but i haven't heard anything new about it
aristogeiton		what do you guys think about using threshold signatures for fair sequencing services

John T		Hi guys, don‚Äôt forget participate the Threshold Network community & NuLink AMA 2 hours later . There is a POAP will be distributed later.    https://discord.gg/Cx6rhkXv
MrsNuBooty		Also remember self-nominations are highly encouraged from everyone except team members.  Team members MUST be nominated by the community.   What that means is if you have a team member that you have unwavering faith in, they need your nomination to be considered for the T Council.  If for some reason you are not comfortable making a nomination but you want to see a candidate in the pool, feel free to DM me.
MrsNuBooty		GM everyone!  A friendly reminder that Threshold Council nominations are happening now and we only have a couple of days left.  Hop on the forum and get involved in the process.  These folks will play a critical role in our governance and it‚Äôs important that we pick the right people for the job.  https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-council-election-nominations/121

Mic		yeah. little too complicated for me. I just know staking and adding to liquidity pools. KEEP staking is just different
East		Seems that you got all the answers in another channel
BegYourPudding		How come?
Naxsun		See it like this. All NU in existence at the time the 'vending machine' as activated, where you can wrap your NU to T, will equal to 4.5B T tokens. So if all these NU tokens are wrapped, there will be 4.5B T tokens out of the NU-T vending machine in circulation.

This 4.5B is a fixed number, can't change.

The amount of NU however is a number that is increasing at the moment. This is the inflation that Isin mentioned above. 

If you look into the merge time-line you see 'Halt Nu Inflation' step. This is the proposal where the NU holders have to vote to stop the NU inflation; yes or no. If this proposal passes, the amount of NU in existence does not change anymore. At this stage you can determine the final token factor, the 3.x.

This token factor goes into the vending machine contract. This is the step 'Vending Machine Contract' (w/fixed token factors) Deployment & Activation'
Isin		yes, cause NU is in inflation now. once the inflation stops, the conversion is fixed. and then it comes to ~3.3.
CHOOPMANSNU		I trust it, as of today. But it seems to change for some reason? I‚Äôd just like to understand what I‚Äôm buying and how that affects conversion at the date T is launched, because some reason my Nu is now worth less T than when I was told to buy it..
Isin		the number is correct. ~3.3T per NU, 4.5T per KEEP. Trust the math , sir.
CHOOPMANSNU		Hi sorry if this is a stupid question, newb here but trying to understand the conversion calculation. How is the Nu/Keep conversion ratio calculated? I am seeing lots of numbers ranging from 3.3-3.7 T for every Nu and ~4.5 T for every Keep, I understand ‚Äú45%‚Äù is distributed to both networks, but I‚Äôm not following the math here. If someone could dumb it down via actual step-calculation that would be super helpful
Mic		sorry but i am not understanding. If I stake keep in coverage pool, is there a chance I can lose some of my KEEP?
kudo94		hey, T will have its own network, the Nu network will develop further, both tokens (KEEP and Nu) will continue to exist
TheSerb		Been a bit out of the loop üò≥
TheSerb		Hello everyone, what exactly happens to the Nucypher privacy layer upon the merger occurring? Does Nucyphers network still continue functioning except it uses T instead NU? In such a case, I‚Äôd assume NU tokens wouldn‚Äôt have any utility?
Chizzle90		Not being being hostile but if everyone reads like 10 questions prior to asking a question these guys wouldn‚Äôt have to answer the same question every 5 questions.  Just a secession so these guys can work.
Agoristen		At least that's what I'd consider "the merge" - vending machine deployment.
Agoristen		If things go according to the plan, it will happen somewhere between December 30th 2021 and Jan 1st 2022.
Anonymouse		Hello guys, when will happen the merge?

```The attacks themselves were demonstrated in a proof of concept manner.

Either way it sounds like something that could potentially impact Threshold Network and/or KEEP ?

Agoristen		It says KEEP were affected. tBTC v1 was/is potentially at risk due to these attacks?

Lowballer356		Thanks, is the Threshold Marketing Guild another discord channel

tomikaze		Hey, sorry if I'm repeating a common question, having trouble finding the answer.  If I hold KEEP and NU what do I need to do to get T.
Ryan C		not yet, still waiting to hear what coinbase is going to do, I personally think they'll make some UI for you to wrap your T but lets see what they do

danio		hi all
MrsNuBooty		Reminder that the T Party starts in 15 minutes on the hangout voice channel https://discord.gg/u6QcmsHZ?event=920451931330199682
zemini		or atleast remaining supply must be rrleased after few months of new T token
zemini		they will also get rewarded if they are able to mint less tokens increased price will compensate for it
maclane		stakers are also holders. + they are doing work by running nodes
zemini		yes if they want holders to be rewarded inflation should be stopped right now and proposal and voting should be done right away
derek		Just to clarify, the KEEP -> T conversion rate is based on total supply not just circulating supply. Total supply of KEEP will be somewhere ~1B
willthesis		Still running but those proposals are dropping super soon
zemini		so gud news is ‚Ä¶ inflation is stopped permanently right now for keep and nu? or is it still happening
zemini		i think then keep will hover between 5 and 8 for some time thenüòÄüòÖüòÄ
pixel_21		Yah I'm interested to see how KEEP & NU prices will correlate with T
East		You got it
zemini		so current circulation supply for keep is 596,456,902 ‚Ä¶ so no more circulation supply and this will be the final maxium supply right for keep if no inflation???? or further inflation will be done implemented later?
Xkoyopa		What will be interesting is to see what happens to Keep/Nu(with no inflation) after T is listed across many exchanges. 

With keep & nu still tradeable and having no inflation market will be very interesting
Xkoyopa		Merger = Keep/Nu nodes operating under same protocol
maclane		but most likely if everyone is paying attention they'll all (or most of them) get wrapped/upgraded to T
maclane		that's just how ethereum works. nu and keep are erc20 tokens and cannot be "deleted"
Xkoyopa		Keep -> T -> Keep ‚úÖ
Nu->T->Nu‚úÖ
Nu->T->Keep‚ùå
Keep->T->Nu‚ùå
zemini		wo why T token if we keep and nu also coexist? merger should mean only one token in existence
pixel_21		Ah interesting
Xkoyopa		You can convert back. You just can't wrap with one token and unwrap to another
Xkoyopa		If T is listed on exchanges wrapping/converting will not be needed(right?)
zemini		?
zemini		if we all converted to T token and can not convert back then obvoisly they wil disappear
Xkoyopa		Keep and Nu will not disappear
zemini		i just hope they dont release the remain supply of  keep and nu Tokens
zemini		yes but slowly i think they will disappear as keep and nu will be converted to T
pixel_21		Dumb question: Keep and NU will coexist with T even after T launch right? Like you can still trade Keep and NU
zemini		i think
zemini		keep and nu conversion to T is different
zemini		wraping is different
Xkoyopa		If exchanges list T wrapping will not be necessary (right?)
zemini		great
maclane		all the exchanges are aware of the merger
Xkoyopa		The exchanges would have to have a mechanism to wrap.
zemini		yes but we jst want to know are exchanges communicated with this and told about it that u want to do this on exchnages as well if they agree
maclane		i'm fairly confident exchanges will support, we just can't speak for them because we're not them üëç
zemini		and eth gas fee is too much for small users .. i think more exchanges should b involved so it can be done on coinbase and binanceüò¢
Del		Was there a keep airdrop announced?
Xkoyopa		Yes
zemini		and will@have tu etherium gas fee?
Xkoyopa		You will be able to swap on metamask
Pink Unicorn 777		That'd be great. Thanks
zemini		i think exchanges must have been taken into this and people holding keep and nu should have the option of it doing it on exchnages like binance
zemini		-are they trying to  ciculation supply for nu and keep  equal? when inflation stops? is this the plan?
maximo3453		Any other nu staker worried about this?
OhmaGa		And we need more than 25% of the total supply to vote yes for this to pass?
OhmaGa		Why does this vote cost gas? is it cuz it's to directly effect the contract?
maximo3453		My only problem with the halt of nu staking rewards is personally most of my nu is locked in a staking pool which I won‚Äôt be able to upgrade until t staking contract. Can nu do what keep did with covering the time stakes are halted such as keep set aside tokens until march? I‚Äôve been reading in the channels and it doesn‚Äôt have a definite day when the staking contracts will be out so it is possible that it‚Äôs pushed back. I can imagine many nu stakers aren‚Äôt happy about that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here long term but as an investor I feel like the nu stakers will be hurt from that. I'm raising this concern since it doesnt take to account the stakers that have commited to the network for several months and getting the bad end of the stick.
maclane		correct, nucypher dao is only nu stakers
Xkoyopa		So, the vote is only for stakers/node operators, right?

danio		hi all
MrsNuBooty		Reminder that the T Party starts in 15 minutes on the hangout voice channel https://discord.gg/u6QcmsHZ?event=920451931330199682
zemini		or atleast remaining supply must be rrleased after few months of new T token
zemini		they will also get rewarded if they are able to mint less tokens increased price will compensate for it
maclane		stakers are also holders. + they are doing work by running nodes
zemini		yes if they want holders to be rewarded inflation should be stopped right now and proposal and voting should be done right away
derek		Just to clarify, the KEEP -> T conversion rate is based on total supply not just circulating supply. Total supply of KEEP will be somewhere ~1B
willthesis		Still running but those proposals are dropping super soon
zemini		so gud news is ‚Ä¶ inflation is stopped permanently right now for keep and nu? or is it still happening
zemini		i think then keep will hover between 5 and 8 for some time thenüòÄüòÖüòÄ
pixel_21		Yah I'm interested to see how KEEP & NU prices will correlate with T
East		You got it
zemini		so current circulation supply for keep is 596,456,902 ‚Ä¶ so no more circulation supply and this will be the final maxium supply right for keep if no inflation???? or further inflation will be done implemented later?
Xkoyopa		What will be interesting is to see what happens to Keep/Nu(with no inflation) after T is listed across many exchanges. 

With keep & nu still tradeable and having no inflation market will be very interesting
Xkoyopa		Merger = Keep/Nu nodes operating under same protocol
maclane		but most likely if everyone is paying attention they'll all (or most of them) get wrapped/upgraded to T
maclane		that's just how ethereum works. nu and keep are erc20 tokens and cannot be "deleted"
Xkoyopa		Keep -> T -> Keep ‚úÖ
Nu->T->Nu‚úÖ
Nu->T->Keep‚ùå
Keep->T->Nu‚ùå
zemini		wo why T token if we keep and nu also coexist? merger should mean only one token in existence
pixel_21		Ah interesting
Xkoyopa		You can convert back. You just can't wrap with one token and unwrap to another
Xkoyopa		If T is listed on exchanges wrapping/converting will not be needed(right?)
zemini		?
zemini		if we all converted to T token and can not convert back then obvoisly they wil disappear
Xkoyopa		Keep and Nu will not disappear
zemini		i just hope they dont release the remain supply of  keep and nu Tokens
zemini		yes but slowly i think they will disappear as keep and nu will be converted to T
pixel_21		Dumb question: Keep and NU will coexist with T even after T launch right? Like you can still trade Keep and NU
zemini		i think
zemini		keep and nu conversion to T is different
zemini		wraping is different
Xkoyopa		If exchanges list T wrapping will not be necessary (right?)
zemini		great
maclane		all the exchanges are aware of the merger
TheArtfulDodger		Just trying to figure out what direct affect it has on me
TheArtfulDodger		If there‚Äôs anybody here familiar with the new inflation model, does the stable yield basically place a max cap of 10% APY on staking rewards or is that wrong?
keanu2themoon		Correct. That is what my question was referring to haha. The current discrepancy is nothing short of remarkable. I will try to brainstorm some ideas and join one of the Marketing Guild meetings.
tejaposh		Can we earn rewards during those 2 months after unbound?
maximo3453		üëÄ
maximo3453		I do know Dre Drexler which does a bit of crypto
FujiMan		guys how can i buy the token? or earn?
MrsNuBooty		
MrsNuBooty		These discussions happen in the Marketing Guild Channel and on the T Party calls!
MrsNuBooty		We have had some really awesome stuff from the MG.  The next video is already under way.  <@850117720573214730> has really taken the lead with these.  We need lots of content but people have to come help actually make it happen.  I can dream all day long but execution and dedicating the time is where it‚Äôs at.
keanu2themoon		Agreed. I think we should have some discussion on how to create high quality short videos that are able to convey what $T is about. Example, those tBTC videos are excellent.
MrsNuBooty		Might be an appropriate time to mention, if anyone wants to help with marketing it is open to everyone.  Start by finding the <#882289615959121990> channel and then react with the emojis for the guilds you want to join.  I know I would love to have even more creative geniuses helping out.  <a:9682_partykeanuparrot:902179752109023273>
MrsNuBooty		It sounded like Keanu2themoon was asking if there was a specific plan for getting the Twitter followers to migrate to the new Twitter.  If someone has some recommendations or a strategy I‚Äôm all ears.  As far as influencers this sounds expensive and as you might  know marketing is currently operating on a budget of 5000 Keep per month.  Unless you know some of these influencers and can ask some favors I‚Äôm not sure how we could bring this to fruition currently.   Once the DAO launches we will be able to post a proposal for a marketing budget but is this the type of stuff we want the budget going to?  Can you give me some examples of good influencers to look at?  Like who do y‚Äôall want shilling T? <:purpcoffee:920707383813091358>

StonedAlgo		as a person with a general interest in NU and only hold some in my wallet.  How much of a cost will the transaction be to convert to the new token?
mr.3ullish		When launch
mr.3ullish		Hello
maclane		Does that make sense?
maclane		The latter is how several other staking networks work and seems to be easier and less confusing for users to reason about, since stake duration and winddown are not very common.
maclane		In NuCypher, when you initiate a stake you specify how long you want to stake for (duration) as well as whether you want to restake or winddown (both of which you can toggle later). If you stake for 6 months and have winddown on, then your stake will unlock in 6 months.

In Threshold, you just stake. When you want to stop staking, you initiate an `unbond` transaction and two months later your stake unlocks.
CouchPusher		Sorry, a lot of this is over my head. 

1) is the amnesty you talk abt regarding my current nu staking node and that I get to unbind from this stake early before my lockup period ends next May ‚Äò22?

2) if #1 üëÜüèºis true, then what is this concept of 2 month unbonding and why does this mean T has no stake duration? Isn‚Äôt it that you can lock in a T stake for 6 months but to unlock it you need to go thru a 2 month waiting process? Not clear on this at all and if it‚Äôs bc I didn‚Äôt read this part of T, then apologies ahead of time but didn‚Äôt know this.
maclane		Because we are subject to legal agreements with vesting, along with other groups like SAFT 2, university stakers, etc. The vesting is enforced on the NuCypher staking contract.
maclane		T has a 2 month unbonding period, so the concept of stake duration goes away. Stakers can initiate unbonding at any time and fully unlock 2 months later. This model is more familiar with other staking networks ala Cosmos/etc.
CouchPusher		*
CouchPusher		Afforded this ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù
CouchPusher		And why is the team not afforded the ability to migrate over directly to T? Is it that the team is providing stability to nu as this migration is happening?
CouchPusher		So amnesty from the remaining term means I as a currently steaker can unlock 5 months early and convert into T and choose to reallocate to node or LP roles in the new threshold network?
maclane		With the change to the T staking contract, you will get amnesty for any remaining duration you have in exchange for the 2 month unbonding period in T (this is *not* the case for me and other team members since we still are subject to the two year vest)
maclane		Yes, we are impacted by any changes to/halting of rewards
CouchPusher		does the 1yr run thru the inflation halt period as well* (is whati meant to ask)
CouchPusher		got it but does the 1yr run thru the inflation period as well? i guess what i'm asking is if the nucypher team is also going to be affected by the non-compensation/halt to inflation as i am? essentially saying had i known about all this when i locked my stake, i probably would've only locked in 6-months from May '21 instead of 1-year with winddown.
maclane		My stake is maxed out to 1yr with winddown off. Same for company stakes. For other team members, I don't know off the top of my head what everyone's situation is other than they can't be fully unstaked because everyone is under a two year vest from mainnet launch (october 15, 2020).
CouchPusher		Will the rest of the nucypher team be staking during this period or have you all unlocked?
Xkoyopa		Truth
danio		Tweets alone are definitely not enough for today's trends. Videos created by influencers and famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts achieve the best results. Tweets don't reach their audience seriously - people just scroll through them quickly. People like to see what's inside and what's highlighted on time
MrsNuBooty		Just to Keep engaging with each other and tweeting at one another.  Do you have other ideas?
keanu2themoon		[Specifically on Twitter] Do we have a marketing plan in place to drive traffic from NuCypher and The KEEP Network to The Threshold Network?

If my trade is open on keep or Nu
On future trade 

Meanwhile merger will happen
Than what will happen to that trade <@414604822616997899> 
And others
maclane		Imo based on the timing considerations it‚Äôs value destructive to delay to pull forward some rewards given we‚Äôd be delaying all the PCV initiatives which  might only be possible in the current market conditions. I think the better route is to move towards T rewards with as quickly as is safely possible and minimize the rewards downtime
maclane		Well, in this case we‚Äôre not really talking about which side of NU v KEEP gets a better deal. The higher NU supply is entirely due to inflation, so it‚Äôs more a question of NU stakers vs NU non-stakers
maclane		The voting period is enforced on-chain by Aragon, we don‚Äôt have discretion over how quickly it can be done. The challenge with freezing inflation based on a projected supply is that it isn‚Äôt deterministic so we can‚Äôt know in advance the exact amount of inflation that would be emitted.

So it‚Äôs something like a week or two of smart contract dev+review, then a week or so audit, then an official prop+2week vote
CouchPusher		I just feel like nu holders getting a crappier deal bc we have a higher supply, lower token factor at 3.3 (currently) vs 4.5 for keep; and we‚Äôre also not getting rewards for up to 1-1.5mths based on the current last commitment period of 12/23. Seems unfair no?
CouchPusher		Why can‚Äôt the proposal to pull forward the 1 month of rewards be done in a shorter amount of time or CONCURRENTLY with the current timeline/process? Can‚Äôt the proposal freeze the supply at the value assuming inflation continues until mid January or Early February? Yes that decreases the token factor for nu holders but it also at least gives us more nu to convert into T.
ie		Laptop works
maclane		works for me on laptop rn
Nikhil		do we know launch date for t token
REZZ4NS		How does that work?
Naxsun		That is correct ser
BegYourPudding		If memory serves, one of the side effects would be that the KEEP to T ratio would go up. Is that what you remember?
Naxsun		It's a proposal to pull forward some rewards and then freeze the remaining. Not sure when, I understood relatively short term
BegYourPudding		Oh has that not been voted on yet? I thought I‚Äôd missed it. Is there an ETA when it‚Äôll be out?
CouchPusher		jeez, to vote for this inflation freezing, we also have to pay gas fees??? wtf...
Naxsun		But until then I'd just stay in the paused pool
Naxsun		They have a new tBTC pool up now on Saddle but it's still empty. The 'paused' pool now has a migrate option. I expect they want all users to migrate, and I imagine that would require a dashboard - reward contract update on KEEP side as well
Naxsun		Yeah, rewards where topped up yesterday. 250k KEEPü§ë
Agoristen		I think it was paused due to an exploit in a third party project (Synapse) that uses Saddle's contracts, funds are safe in the pool, but it's not getting SDL rewards. However, last I checked KEEP rewards are still ongoing in the pool, just no new deposits allowed. Withdraw KEEP rewards can be done manually through etherscan
TheArtfulDodger		Awesome thanks for the explanation. I‚Äôm hoping we don‚Äôt reach that figure too quickly. Going from 50% APY to 10% is kind of a bummer, but I understand the indirect result would be a more valuable token, which would offset the difference
Naxsun		Actually I've seen different definitions being used. Circulating supply including and excluding staked tokens. Not sure if there's an official definition and what Binance uses
zemini		hmm
Naxsun		Circulating supply is difficult to predict, because it depends on the holders of those what they will do with it. Liquid supply is expect to increase yes, with how much is in that schedule
zemini		as it was hard to understand this from graph for me dont know why
zemini		til@janauary 2022 how much circulation supply of keep@should be expected ?
Naxsun		Sure. Appreciate that you're taking the time to read through thisüëçüèª
zemini		so one last dumb question from my side
Naxsun		Also thing such as staking / staking can affect circulating supply
Naxsun		The total supply has only being going down since launch
Naxsun		The 'token factor', which is the the amount of T that you get per Keep is determined on the total supply. Not the circulating supply
zemini		i understand this
zemini		yes thats what i m talking abt circulation supply now let me read the schedule wil ask futther i had any quesfion
Naxsun		If the merge with NuCypher would not have happened, the total circulating supply of Keep over time would have increased to 1B minus any token burns due to slashing
OhmaGa		And besides it doesnt matter the difference between nu and keep since they are viewed as the same at this point
Naxsun		Ok hear me out. There is no increase in Keep supply. The Keep supply has always been 1B. 

This is total supply, unlocked and locked (non circulating, locked and can not be transferred). 

Due to some slashing events in the past the supply was reduced to 999,848,748 (these approx 150 million tokens were burned)

The numbers that you are talking about are circulating supply. The liquid supply increase schedule is fixed (unlocked), you can see that here:
https://messari.io/asset/keep-network/profile/supply-schedule

This is not something that someone is 'manually unlocking'. This is according the contract. The contract is immutable
zemini		<@414702747175092224>  i have stoped plz thpeüòÖ
zemini		i am saying whoever is doing this is not doing gud üòÖ
OhmaGa		The team is not just minting tokens and putting them into circulation if that's what you're trying to get at
zemini		oky stopped
zemini		its was on 596 for quite a time but after 16 its on icrease
Naxsun		Ok here it goes. Stop typing lol
jakelynch		min* yield
zemini		i m jst making one assumption as circuslfion supply is increasing it will bring the prices down many people will suffer losses on trading .. my only one point now u may write i am all ears and eyes
zemini		i m listening.
Naxsun		You're making lots of wrong assumptions here
Naxsun		Honestly, you're understanding the situation wrong. I'm ok to explain but only if you promise to listen
zemini		people can earn rewards by staking T as well there is no need to increase circulation supply at the moment thats i am saying in this critical unpredictable market people who are long gonna suffer huge here i think
Naxsun		No need to share all screenshots. You're misunderstanding the numbers. Let me try to explain
zemini		circulation supply showing  was 596 456 902
Naxsun		Ok I'm not an expert and the exact numbers are as far as I know tbd. But it's not a max yield. The stable yield mechanism has the intention that when the staking rate increases (more % of the tokens are staked) and the yield goes down, that there is a minimum yield % that is earned by a staker.

The purpose of this is that it's also economically interesting for smaller stakers to stake. 

If this was not the case it could be that the operational cost would be higher than the earnings --> nodes would eventually stop --> negative effect on the network
zemini		check my message date 16 december 2021
zemini		
zemini		30 -48 hours earlier i checked keep circulafion supply on binance its 596xxxxxxsomething  now its 601xxxxxxxx
Naxsun		On the contrary even, there is a proposal being prepared that once approved the supply is going to end up lower as originally projected
zemini		let me share my old mesage
zemini		i saw it my self u i keep
Naxsun		I think you're misunderstanding something. There is no supply increase for Keep
zemini		
Newkatz		What if the coin eg keep is held in an exchange like coinbase and it does not support the conversion, won't it be costly to convert?
maximo3453		The tutorials will come once we get closer to merge
danio		how to wrap with eterscan? show you a tutorial on how to do it?
Xkoyopa		Thanks for the clarification
maclane		Slight correction: you wouldn‚Äôt wrap/upgrade with Uniswap
Xkoyopa		The market will decide the price
Xkoyopa		Market will determine price of them. Many people plan on wrapping to T so one could assume a drop in value of Nu/Keep, however, it totally depends on amount of people wrapping to T or buying/selling Nu/Keep.
Xkoyopa		You will need to wrap them to T using etherscan or uniswap, etc...
Value of nu/keep totally depends upon supply/demand. The 2 tokens will continue to be tradeable even after T launches.

Bishop		Thank you!
Xkoyopa		The plus side of upgrading to T will be the reward mechanisms. 

Once T launches there will be no more staking rewards for Nu/Keep(someone please correct me if this is wrong)
A plus side to buying nu/keep after T launch will be that the inflation of the 2 tokens will cease, freezing the supply of the tokens to whatever they are at T launch(once again, someone correct me if I'm wrong here)
willthesis		Yes KEEP and NU will continue to exist. The merge process is opt-in which means no one has to upgrade to Threshold if they do not want to.
Bishop		Oh, I see. So im assuming once T officially gets listed, NU and KEEP will not be available to buy anymore.
Xkoyopa		Don't know a real answer...but at the time of launch the only way to get T is to wrap, meaning until an exchange actually offers T tokens you will have to buy nu or keep to get T. No one knows how long it will take exchanges to list T.
Bishop		token*
Bishop		Question: Once the merger is complete, will NU and KEEP exist as tokens projects to invest in on their own?
sem_owner_died		Thank you!
maclane		there will be a dashboard, yes. alternatively, you can do it directly via e.g. etherscan
maclane		no fee, other than ETH gas costs
sem_owner_died		Hi everyone, how can we convert NU/KEEP to T?
I heard that keep is allowing to wrap on their dashboard (when time arrives).
Is there a similar plan from NU? <@405654833131945984> 
Also, would there be a fee to wrap NU/KEEP to T? Everything is erc 20 and assuming there is gas cost associated to do a smart contract what is the estimated fee. Is it flat or variable depending on the # of tokens?

Evandro Saturnino		We don't have any information if Binance will support the T token transition, talking about exchanges, this will be up to them: They could facilitate the way for upgrading the tokens to T or it could be that you will need to follow the wrapping process everyone else follows, by doing it outside the exchange.

maximo3453		After nu inflation is stopped there will be exact amount of how many T per nu you will get

ghard1314		Also also there will probably be lots of commercial applications like medical records, confidential documents, etc
ghard1314		Also encrypted art allows the owner to lease out access to the art they own so that they can earn passive income from owning that piece of art
ghard1314		This is a big part of what we are working on as well. We imagine that there will always be some public facing part of each art nft, but the encrypted part will give the owner deeper access into the art such as behind the scenes, a layered breakdown, etc.
beccazican		Been wanting to see institutions like art museums use them as tickets...could showcase artist being exhibited or something along those lines. I think nfts will impact commercial media through copyright protections and other security features too
vivek		I dunno maybe even an amazon gift code or something like that kept private makes more sense than "art"
vivek		but maybe for legal documents...
vivek		is NULink like an API where everyone can use PRE to make parts of an NFT accessible to a few, or just a website that uses PRE? Encrypted/private art still sounds dumb

REZZ4NS		Oh wow that's awesome, thanks!
Naxsun		There is a specific token factor for KEEP and for NU. The token factor is the amount of T you get per KEEP / NU and is determined by dividing 4.5B by the total supply of the respective token.

For Keep, the max supply was always 1B. There were some tokens slashed in the passed, that made the total supply expected to be a little under 1B. However, there was a certain amount of tokens reserved for 'network incentives'. For example staker rewards, LP rewards & Coverage pool rewards come out of this bucket. The proposal that is going to drop soon will be to set aside some of these tokens for rewards up to March '22, the remainder of this bucket however will not be used anymore.

In essence this means the total supply of Keep is lower than what was originally assumed by some people --> 4.5B divided by a smaller number is a higher token factor
Nikhil		do we know launch date for t token
REZZ4NS		How does that work?
Naxsun		That is correct ser
BegYourPudding		If memory serves, one of the side effects would be that the KEEP to T ratio would go up. Is that what you remember?
Naxsun		It's a proposal to pull forward some rewards and then freeze the remaining. Not sure when, I understood relatively short term

Naxsun		They have a new tBTC pool up now on Saddle but it's still empty. The 'paused' pool now has a migrate option. I expect they want all users to migrate, and I imagine that would require a dashboard - reward contract update on KEEP side as well
Naxsun		Yeah, rewards where topped up yesterday. 250k KEEPü§ë
Agoristen		I think it was paused due to an exploit in a third party project (Synapse) that uses Saddle's contracts, funds are safe in the pool, but it's not getting SDL rewards. However, last I checked KEEP rewards are still ongoing in the pool, just no new deposits allowed. Withdraw KEEP rewards can be done manually through etherscan
TheArtfulDodger		Awesome thanks for the explanation. I‚Äôm hoping we don‚Äôt reach that figure too quickly. Going from 50% APY to 10% is kind of a bummer, but I understand the indirect result would be a more valuable token, which would offset the difference
Naxsun		Actually I've seen different definitions being used. Circulating supply including and excluding staked tokens. Not sure if there's an official definition and what Binance uses
zemini		hmm
Naxsun		Circulating supply is difficult to predict, because it depends on the holders of those what they will do with it. Liquid supply is expect to increase yes, with how much is in that schedule
zemini		as it was hard to understand this from graph for me dont know why
zemini		til@janauary 2022 how much circulation supply of keep@should be expected ?
Naxsun		Sure. Appreciate that you're taking the time to read through thisüëçüèª
zemini		so one last dumb question from my side
Naxsun		Also thing such as staking / staking can affect circulating supply
Naxsun		The total supply has only being going down since launch
Naxsun		The 'token factor', which is the the amount of T that you get per Keep is determined on the total supply. Not the circulating supply
zemini		i understand this
zemini		yes thats what i m talking abt circulation supply now let me read the schedule wil ask futther i had any quesfion
Naxsun		If the merge with NuCypher would not have happened, the total circulating supply of Keep over time would have increased to 1B minus any token burns due to slashing
OhmaGa		And besides it doesnt matter the difference between nu and keep since they are viewed as the same at this point
Naxsun		Ok hear me out. There is no increase in Keep supply. The Keep supply has always been 1B. 

This is total supply, unlocked and locked (non circulating, locked and can not be transferred). 

Due to some slashing events in the past the supply was reduced to 999,848,748 (these approx 150 million tokens were burned)

The numbers that you are talking about are circulating supply. The liquid supply increase schedule is fixed (unlocked), you can see that here:
https://messari.io/asset/keep-network/profile/supply-schedule

This is not something that someone is 'manually unlocking'. This is according the contract. The contract is immutable
zemini		<@414702747175092224>  i have stoped plz thpeüòÖ
zemini		i am saying whoever is doing this is not doing gud üòÖ
OhmaGa		The team is not just minting tokens and putting them into circulation if that's what you're trying to get at
Naxsun		These details are to be announced. It's essentially up to the centralized exchanges how they'll handle the merge & token wrapping
Naxsun		You're english is great!
CryptoWalker		I am a newbie and my English is really bad. But I think you have to connect your wallet to the keep dashboard on the keep website and press a button after selecting a quantity. Connect the wallet is easy, I have done it to try staking but my keep supply is too low.
wexsider		Question: once the next steps are complete and T token is up, how does the process of exchanging your NU/Keep to T will look like. For sake of example: Lets say an individual has 100 Keep on Kucoin and wants to upgrade it to T > what would be the steps required from that individual? Thank you
Naxsun		It'll strongly depend on the usage and fee structure of the service. For example on tBTC how many times the bridge is crossed & back. 

I haven't done any predictions personally but I believe some modelling is done by others so I'll let those pitch in
CouchPusher		Guys - if anyone knows - quick question regarding fees and inflation in a post-merger world. Will the fees collected via T trxns be more than the nominal dollar of inflation per year? Understand that inflation depends on the proposal of fixed rate return/APY I saw from a month ago, but any thoughts?
ghard1314		Also, as far as I understand, the NuLink team is working on a way to use the PRE services from other chains, so that may also be an option. I haven't studied it a ton but it might require giving up a bit of the atomicness might not be feasible, depending on the usecase
ghard1314		yeah we are trying to build as chain agnostic as possible. I know the Nu team has been thinking of multichain opportunities and we will be the first to deploy with them.
vivek		Nice. I don't have much knowledge about bridging NFTs  and multichain NFTs but I guess if u are sticking with the two standards you mentioned it would be possible in the future if that tech is developed and NU goes multichain too
ghard1314		We plan to have a working demo out by the first couple weeks of the year. To make it truly decentralized, we will also need the `AbioticAlice` initiative thats currently in development by the Nu team. I believe they mentioned that was slotted for release in late Q1/early Q2
vivek		sounds great. When is the ETA of PRE APIs being available for others to use the tech for encrypted NFTs?
carlosdp.eth		ok cool, thanks!
maclane		<a:peepoWave:859976231507197962> not yet, but soon! for now, you can build on top of nucypher/keep and port your application over to threshold when everything is ready, which shouldn't be too long
East		Hey, there are resources on how to setup nodes both for Keep and Nucypher. Marketing Guild is working rn on getting this some lhow organized for new node operators joining the merged Threshold Network. I‚Äôll get back with these
carlosdp.eth		üëã  is it possible to build on top of Threshold right now?
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		OK, <@!410212090289192960>, let's throw a little fuel on this fire:

What is the current most common problem with grant-time node discovery?

And what's the clearest way to reproduce it?
jakelynch		cool ty
AJ		thanks <@!725111730824413379> , is there a link i can follow to setup nodes
East		But you also can put your KEEP and later T to work in Coverage Pools or in the KEEP/ETH LP. For NU there is also staking options.
East		Yes, you could run a node and stake KEEP or NU, and at some point really soon only T.
ghard1314		Our plan is to make it backwards compatible with existing standards (ERC721/1155). Also we plan to only encrypt the media files needing to be secured. That way everyone will know where the media file is located but only the current owner of the token can decrypt it through PRE
jakelynch		Good question, I think there are a lot of ways to do it but if i were to do it, i'd probably encrypt the url in the nft metadata. <@!405654833131945984> should be able to say much more about this tho *a la creaton/masterfile*
vivek		No need to propose a new eth standard, Right?
vivek		Ok so with regards to encrypted NFTs, what will remain on chain?
AJ		Hi Guys, i'm new here, i am a bit overwhelmed with all the information flowing around here, can i be a validator?
ghard1314		Also also there will probably be lots of commercial applications like medical records, confidential documents, etc
ghard1314		Also encrypted art allows the owner to lease out access to the art they own so that they can earn passive income from owning that piece of art
ghard1314		This is a big part of what we are working on as well. We imagine that there will always be some public facing part of each art nft, but the encrypted part will give the owner deeper access into the art such as behind the scenes, a layered breakdown, etc.
beccazican		Been wanting to see institutions like art museums use them as tickets...could showcase artist being exhibited or something along those lines. I think nfts will impact commercial media through copyright protections and other security features too
vivek		I dunno maybe even an amazon gift code or something like that kept private makes more sense than "art"
vivek		but maybe for legal documents...
vivek		is NULink like an API where everyone can use PRE to make parts of an NFT accessible to a few, or just a website that uses PRE? Encrypted/private art still sounds dumb
keanu2themoon		No reason at all.
Matt Luongo		looks good so far
vivek		any reason to think NU inflation halt won't pass?
vivek		when official official final final date announcement?
Naxsun		We're just getting started and it's encouraged for all to pitch in
Naxsun		<@!845079778398699540> <@!574808873651929098> if you go to <#882289615959121990> you can opt in the 'Marketing Guild' channels. That's where these ideas, among others, are discussed
Naxsun		Pretty cool to see the support so far for the inflation suspension proposal<:emoji_54:912202987433230346>
BegYourPudding		I‚Äôm started a course called DeFi untangled and launching a YouTube channel to explain new tech, so happy to work with people. My Co-founder and I are writers and animators, so can massage scripts and make it look high end
leche		We need to pay a YouTuber to ELI5 why they should use tBTC instead of wrapping their Bitcoin
MrsNuBooty		Well someone with official NuCypher account access is on it this morning and just cranking in the new followers on theTnetwork account.  It‚Äôs up 20+ followers in the last hour. üòé https://twitter.com/nucypher/status/1472965127167090692?s=21
Naxsun		Latest timeline can be found here: https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/918665346913820683
REZZ4NS		Oh wow that's awesome, thanks!
Naxsun		There is a specific token factor for KEEP and for NU. The token factor is the amount of T you get per KEEP / NU and is determined by dividing 4.5B by the total supply of the respective token.

For Keep, the max supply was always 1B. There were some tokens slashed in the passed, that made the total supply expected to be a little under 1B. However, there was a certain amount of tokens reserved for 'network incentives'. For example staker rewards, LP rewards & Coverage pool rewards come out of this bucket. The proposal that is going to drop soon will be to set aside some of these tokens for rewards up to March '22, the remainder of this bucket however will not be used anymore.

In essence this means the total supply of Keep is lower than what was originally assumed by some people --> 4.5B divided by a smaller number is a higher token factor
Nikhil		do we know launch date for t token
REZZ4NS		How does that work?
Naxsun		That is correct ser
BegYourPudding		If memory serves, one of the side effects would be that the KEEP to T ratio would go up. Is that what you remember?
Naxsun		It's a proposal to pull forward some rewards and then freeze the remaining. Not sure when, I understood relatively short term
vivek		huobi and upbit too. the rest not so important
vivek		we need binance and kraken to announce their platforms wrt to T merge plz
derek		I guess we'll need to make that clearer üòÖ - it just represents the Ursula information that was returned from the network, and then how it gets used by Alice. It also prevented the return arrow from the Network from having to go all the way back to Alice and making the diagram cluttered üòÇ
ghard1314		Just wondering what this box is supposed to represent? I am assuming its basically representing Alice's `SigningPower` but i'm not sure
derek		üôè - fyi we recently updated the diagrams in our `latest` (i.e. bleeding edge) docs to reflect the upcoming TMapConKFrags paradigm - in case you or anyone else needs a reference:
- <https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/#how-does-nucypher-work>
- <https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/character.html>
ghard1314		I know there has been some back and forth on the TMapConKfrags, but I for one really like the idea. Its very clean and simplifies a lot of the state management
Xkoyopa		Makes it alot easier to explain to people the way it works
Xkoyopa		Awesome, great explanation. I fully comprehend the process now
i-exist-now		im working on a ml project regarding the indus valley cipher
we found two languages with visual similarity
1 is decrypted, the other is unknown
neither have datasets on them
any suggestions?
derek		Yep, the `nucypher` API and the NuCypher Network (soon to be merged with Keep Network into Threshold Network) would be a  cryptographic service used by dApps to facilitate functionality - in this case secure data sharing and access control.
Xkoyopa		Beautiful, thanks for the breakdown.
So, Bob and Alice go through a dApp which utilizes the Nucypher network to perform the encryption/decryption?
derek		We are working on a new version called TreasureMap Con Kfrags, where instead of the `n` kfrags being stored by `n` Ursulas, each kfrag is encrypted for a corresponding Ursula and is included in the TreasureMap. So instead of `n` Ursulas storing the kfrags, the `n` encrypted kfrags are included in the TreasureMap that Bob possesses <https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/character.html#alice-grant>. Note that since each kfrag is encrypted for a specific Ursula, Bob never has access to any kfrag in plaintext form even though he has the TreasureMap.  As part of the re-encryption, Bob would then send the encrypted kfrag (instead of Ursulas already having it) and the capsule to the relevant Ursulas, and then the rest of the process occurs as before. See <https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/character.html#bob-retrieve> (note that the links in this paragraph for TreasureMap Con KFrags are to the `latest` version of the docs and different from the `stable` version of the docs which I provided in the prior paragraph.
derek		In the current released version of the protocol - Alice creates a re-encryption key, splits it into `n` shares (kfrags) (only `m` are needed for re-encryption). `n` Ursulas each receive 1 kfrag and store their respective kfrag (<https://docs.nucypher.com/en/stable/architecture/character.html#alice-grant>). For re-encryption, Bob sends the capsule to each of the relevant Ursulas, who  each use their own kfrag to perform an operation on the capsule, and return a cfrag. Bob collects `m` cfrags (out of `n` i.e. the threshold) and attaches them to the capsule to obtain a re-encrypted capsule for Bob, and he can now decrypt the capsule with his private key to get the symmetric encryption key in the capsule and then use the symmetric key to decrypt the data that was shared (<https://docs.nucypher.com/en/stable/architecture/character.html#bob-retrieve>).
Xkoyopa		I think I understand now. Thanks <@412648164710023168>
Xkoyopa		So when Alice creates a Re-Encryption key, do all of the Ursula's(nodes) receive the whole key, or do they(the nodes)only receive a k-frag that is put back together by Bob?
Xkoyopa		Thanks, I was just trying to understand the mechanics of how the PRE works. So Nucypher generates the Key, and the Bob or Alice get the key in the App that is being used
derek		Bob's keypair (public key and private key) can be generated through the `nucypher` API (by the app or directly). Bob's overall configuration can be stored in a configuration file with information about the keystore. The public key can then be part of Bob's profile in the app. 

I believe there is also the possibility to import Bob's keypair from an external source (assuming the same curve is used) - there is work being done on `rust-umbral` and `nucypher-ts` on the browser side so cc <@!454885338360315904> and <@!345959207859912706> to ensure that I'm not mistaken.
Xkoyopa		Yeah, so I was wondering about the private key that Bob uses to decrypt the data. How does Bob obtain that private key. Is he assigned a private key by the app that is utilizing the Nucypher(Threshold) network?
derek		Unsure what you mean  - these docs may help: <https://docs.nucypher.com/en/stable/index.html#how-does-nucypher-work>, <https://docs.nucypher.com/en/stable/architecture/character.html>.

Happy to answer any follow-up questions
Xkoyopa		With PRE, does Alice only give the cypher text or also the key?
Naxsun		Getting fired up for the launch?
Isin		T! In the transformers.
Isin		
Naxsun		Hey. Read here https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/923100091370332161
0x84000		any there any guide on this
0x84000		hey guys, im holding NU on Coinlist, should i do anthing about it
0x84000		hello
Naxsun		We made this infographic a while back. Take into the account that this has the supply numbers of June 10th 2021. Meanwhile these numbers have changed.

The supply numbers are expect to be final soon, after which the final token factors will be calculated. We'll make an updated infograph after that
Naxsun		
Naxsun		So actually as long as the Ethereum block chain exists also KEEP and NU tokens will remain to exist. But the transfer to T will happen through a 'wrapping' process. There will be 2 'vending machine' contracts.

An owner of KEEP or NU will be able to lock these tokens in this contract, and in return they receive T tokens. 

So if you're currently holding one of these or both, it's not that you'll receive T tokens and also keep the existing tokens. 

The transfer to T is opt in, but the expectation is that the majority of holders will do so. There are also KEEP and NU tokens that are still locked. These can not be wrapped to T. 

For this, adapter contracts will be made available that allows owners of KEEP and NU to stake on the Threshold network as if they were holding T
Naxsun		These details are to be announced. It's essentially up to the centralized exchanges how they'll handle the merge & token wrapping
Naxsun		You're english is great!
CryptoWalker		I am a newbie and my English is really bad. But I think you have to connect your wallet to the keep dashboard on the keep website and press a button after selecting a quantity. Connect the wallet is easy, I have done it to try staking but my keep supply is too low.

kudo94		Hey, <#870383905314832395> please)
milktruk		When moon
willthesis		Check <#870384195636199455> for the proposal link and vote link. The vote is still happening but looks like it will be yes
Greystroke		Do we know if Nucypher DAO has voted yet to confirm rewards are ending at the end of 2021?
willthesis		Also keep in mind our community voted to extend ECDSA staking rewards until March 2022 a while back. That amount is included in the current proposal to pull forward
Greystroke		I know I am going to buy some more Keep since I am sure most ppl do not realize this yet
Greystroke		So Nucypher rewards end 12/31 but Keep rewards going until May 2022. I guess that good for Keep but I am surprised Nu community OK with that.  I am guessing ppl will sell Nu and buy Keep between January and May
willthesis		And then the coverage pool transitions to T and so do rewards as determined by the Threshold DAO
willthesis		So that was pure inflation our inflation came from network incentives. We need to pull forward a certain amount of those network incentives to keep everything running smoothly while we transition to Threshold
Greystroke		Got it, so will still get coverage pool rewards until May?
willthesis		You don't need to initiate a cool down now unless you want to wrap into T before May
Greystroke		But aren‚Äôt Nucypher rewards ending on 12/31?  Why would Keep rewards keep going?
willthesis		If this proposal passes the KEEP rewards would end in May 2022 but by that time it will transition to T rewards from the DAO
Greystroke		Will we need to convert covKeep to Keep to wrap to T, or will it automatically convert from covKeep to covT?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Heard some along the lines of 1st week of feb during the last T conf.call.. is that the staking?
Greystroke		When do rewards on the coverage pool end for Keep?  Should we be initiating our cooldown now?
willthesis		Staking will not be available immediately after the wrap goes live. It won't be long after but there is not a specific date
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Cool! Does that mean we can start staking our T then after wrapping?
willthesis		Wrapping Keep to T will be ready end of next week without delays but the coverage pool will not transition to T until next year
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		And coverter for keep to T and covkeep to covT will be around 1st week of feb?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Got it
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Goti
willthesis		No it does not! The weekly KEEP reward amount stays the same there. 

It impacts coverage pools by extending rewards until May 2022 to give the Threshold DAO time to set up systems to take over liquidity rewards and to give the teams time to transition coverage pools from KEEP to T.
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Hey guys, does the new KEEP inflammation proposal affect the apr of covKEEP staking?
vivek		Would be good that the merge is smooth from the user experience side of things too.
vivek		Surely u have people that can do this . I would be worried if even under less pressing times the devs are the ones communicating with exchanges and doing PR

Isin		T! In the transformers.
wexsider		Merry Christmas to all. I got another question about the merger which surely was answered before but still: once T is live and everyone starts converting their tokens from NU/Keep into T, wouldn‚Äôt that cause the prices of NU/Keep to drop or will all three tokens be interconnected in price in some way? Thank you!

Agoristen		Only backup plan is that you have your seed somewhere (and that it correspond to your trezor). If you're worried that you might have made a mistake when writing down the seed, either set up another trezor with the seed or use an offline computer running Tails and with iancoleman's tool (https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to view addresses to make sure they correspond to your current Trezor. 

But I don't think I've ever had to do a restore during upgrade.
Agoristen		No need to enter the seed phrase, that's only if it goes bad (just don't disconnect the device during upgrade).
Xkoyopa		Epic
maclane		The contracts as currently written need a fixed total supply
deneme / "the gloves are off"		If the Nu inflation vote doesn't pass, will this hinder the merger or will it just cause the Nu/T ratio to drop?
East		Trezor firmware upgrade implies erasing it and install it from scratch using seed phrase , right ? Any problems with that? Did you have a back up plan in place ? these questions were stopping me from doing the upgrade
OhmaGa		At 24% right now. About ~6 million more nu and we're all good
Agoristen		Thanks, figured it out. Had to upgrade Trezor to latest firmware (2.4.3) it has support for EIP-712, then I had to login using Trezor (with Metamask) option instead of Metamask
vivek		Can the devs do something?
Xkoyopa		Hopefully more people will vote on the Nu proposal to halt inflation. Only at 20% right now. Needs minimum 25%
Evandro Saturnino		The proposal has passed a few hours ago, I believe we will have an announcement soon the inflation gets halted
Xkoyopa		Awesome üëç
So inflation has been halted?
Evandro Saturnino		The multisig vote for halting Keep inflation has passed already
Xkoyopa		So when does the Keep multisig vote on halting inflation?
Evandro Saturnino		https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/discussions/1189
Evandro Saturnino		Yep, this seems to be the case, accessed snapshot discord, and they are talking about the same problem
Agoristen		I have a developer version of firefox running where I've installed v9.8.4 of metamask, tried it there too but same issue. Perhaps snapshot is simply incompatible with Trezor for the time being?
benlongstaff		you could try using an older version of metamask, seems other people are have had the same issue https://forum.trezor.io/t/snapshot-doesnt-work-with-trezor/4549
Agoristen		Yes, but it's been a while since I last voted because I did not have any voting power in any of the staker-only votes
benlongstaff		have you been able to vote in other snapshots?
Agoristen		Any way to fix that? Without extracting private keys / seed....
Agoristen		I'm unable to vote in the snapshot:
```{
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "MetaMask Message Signature: Error: Not supported on this device",
    "data": {
        "originalError": {}

Minh Tran		Merry Xmas guys üôÇ
vivek		probably remains there until they change it later to T for u
teo.		If I have Keep on Revolut, what is going to happen after merge?
Kris		Excited for the council elections!!! Absolutely outstanding group of candidates üëè
But the real question is wen glowing <@!359389391732604949> emoji
kudo94		Hey, <#870383905314832395> please)
milktruk		When moon
willthesis		Check <#870384195636199455> for the proposal link and vote link. The vote is still happening but looks like it will be yes
Greystroke		Do we know if Nucypher DAO has voted yet to confirm rewards are ending at the end of 2021?
willthesis		Also keep in mind our community voted to extend ECDSA staking rewards until March 2022 a while back. That amount is included in the current proposal to pull forward
Greystroke		I know I am going to buy some more Keep since I am sure most ppl do not realize this yet
Greystroke		So Nucypher rewards end 12/31 but Keep rewards going until May 2022. I guess that good for Keep but I am surprised Nu community OK with that.  I am guessing ppl will sell Nu and buy Keep between January and May
willthesis		And then the coverage pool transitions to T and so do rewards as determined by the Threshold DAO
willthesis		So that was pure inflation our inflation came from network incentives. We need to pull forward a certain amount of those network incentives to keep everything running smoothly while we transition to Threshold
Greystroke		Got it, so will still get coverage pool rewards until May?
willthesis		You don't need to initiate a cool down now unless you want to wrap into T before May
Greystroke		But aren‚Äôt Nucypher rewards ending on 12/31?  Why would Keep rewards keep going?
willthesis		If this proposal passes the KEEP rewards would end in May 2022 but by that time it will transition to T rewards from the DAO
Greystroke		Will we need to convert covKeep to Keep to wrap to T, or will it automatically convert from covKeep to covT?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Heard some along the lines of 1st week of feb during the last T conf.call.. is that the staking?
Greystroke		When do rewards on the coverage pool end for Keep?  Should we be initiating our cooldown now?
willthesis		Staking will not be available immediately after the wrap goes live. It won't be long after but there is not a specific date
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Cool! Does that mean we can start staking our T then after wrapping?
willthesis		Wrapping Keep to T will be ready end of next week without delays but the coverage pool will not transition to T until next year
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		And coverter for keep to T and covkeep to covT will be around 1st week of feb?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Got it
Naxsun		24.25% at the moment
Naxsun		Happy holidays!
vivek		has NU passed the threshold yeT?
vivek		the voting website doesn't load with my safari on M1 mac
East		ty bro, you too ! Hope you‚Äôre recovered already!
Chrispy		wishing all the devs and guild members happy holidays and a well deserved break from all their hard work and efforts ‚ô•Ô∏è
Xkoyopa		
Xkoyopa		Almost there
BMurr		Thank you!
East		You have plenty of time, since the token factor to wrap will stay the same indefinitely.
BMurr		Hey everyone, long time holder here‚Äîjust looking for general advice: if you believe in T, the best bet is to immediately wrap to T when possible, right?
Naxsun		I think so yes. But maybe others will pitch in with ideas. Not an expert on snapshot tbh.

Sure! Happy holidays!
Vinch		Ok then I think I have to give it a miss. Probably next time. Thanks for shedding some light on this.
Naxsun		The only way you could use that voting power is to actually connect that wallet to snapshot
Naxsun		You probably can't. I mean, that CB wallet would be elligible for voting, but CB holds the keys...

afaik these cex's don't allow you to vote on proposals and such (yet)
Vinch		I guess the timing could be the problem as my CB wallet only got NU since yesterday. On another hand, if I keep my NU in CB (not the wallet), which is centralized exchange, how could I prove the ownership/time stamp for voting?
Naxsun		Ah that's a good question. I don't know when the snapshot for voting was taken. That could be the issue yes
Vinch		Yes I selected 4 candidates then click the vote link. Btw, I bought NU from CB 8 months ago but only transfer 50 NU to CB wallet yesterday for voting. Am I eligible?
Naxsun		You could check if your address is in the voter list. I'm not too familiar with Coinbase wallet. Did you select who you wanted to vote on?
Naxsun		No details available at this stage. Hang tight for any official announcements
Naxsun		No details available at this stage
vivek		5 days to merge. Binance still nothing about what happens to the NU/KEEP there?
Jun888king		How do we deal with the nu staking on the coinlist?
Weedzy		Merry Christmas to everyone! Next year's spotlight will be on Threshold and this community!! üòªüéÄüéÑ
Vinch		There are approx 50 NU in the CB wallet (transferred from my CB account yesterday).
Vinch		Regarding NU holders voting, I‚Äôve selected the candidates and clicked the ‚Äúvote‚Äù link on discord. It connected to my CB wallet but then nothing happened after that. Is there anything I missed?
zemini		yes i did
kudo94		please check Inflation Calculation in Proposal
zemini		https://forum.keep.network/t/proposal-pause-keep-inflation-to-calculate-token-factor-for-threshold/375  now i understandüòÇ
zemini		but what is proposal about stopping keep inflation? if it was already fixed for max supply?
kudo94		hey, please check this message: https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/922109156666794026
zemini		so keep 601 921 365 circulation supplly at the moment.. it will not increase now and will be final total supply right?
kudo94		Hey, Threshold is an independent network, the Nu and Keep networks will continue to exist.  Prices for them will be determined by the market, you can discuss it in <#870383905314832395>
wexsider		Merry Christmas to all.

An0		Why? This is not an integrity issue with the server/website. Also it appears threshold.network is just a static website getting the good ol‚Äô T gospel out. FWIW modern browsers stopped handshakes over 1.0 and 1.1 on your behalf. Although, if you have a non modern device (like 1% of people by now I‚Äôm guessing) some websites keep previous versions of TLS as to not lose those clients connections completely. Not a big deal if you‚Äôre statically hosting. Shoot even AWS has endpoints (like any non FIPS compliment) that support lower versions of TLS because client compatibility and $$$. Basically this is a client side issue plus I‚Äôd rather them focus on the product
ie		If I am not mistaken you have to be a staker to validate the proposal.
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Not sure if it matters much if the site isn‚Äôt directly used ‚ù§Ô∏è
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Devs I would strongly urge disabling tls 1.0 and 1.1 on threshold.network. Then disable any remaining tls 1.2/1.3 weak ciphers before launch and make sure the code is compatible with secure https. Thanks!!!

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=threshold.network&s=104.21.0.199
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Is there a final ratio for nu? I saw keep had posted 4.xx a while back:)
Vinch		I‚Äôve transferred my NU from CB to CL but not staked yet. I still keep a very small portion of NU in both CB and CB wallet.
Xkoyopa		Fire! Stoked af
vivek		hopefully exchanges clarify their plans wrt the merge on Monday
vivek		NU proposal to halt inflation has just met threshold
ie		Are you a staker?
Naxsun		Other than that Discord is the best place to stay up to date
Naxsun		Update blogs are shared here https://blog.threshold.network/
Naxsun		If you're able to / want to read code the GitHub would be the best place
Xkoyopa		I feel you on that
vivek		esp not with 500-1000 dollar fee to buy eth, send, swap then send/stake
vivek		yes, but average user doesn't use a dex
Xkoyopa		They could swap in some in some dex, right?
Xkoyopa		Oh yeah, true dat
RominUwU		Where can I follow the process btw of T network?
vivek		they can only buy NU
vivek		they can't - it is not listed on their exchanges
Xkoyopa		They could swap to keep
RominUwU		damn that sucks for them
vivek		NU is good to buy if u are a korean who can only buy NU but not Keep
RominUwU		Thank you guys
vivek		considering u get 40% more T if u buy KEEP, that is the logical choice
Xkoyopa		Go with keep, you get more t
RominUwU		2021
RominUwU		I have been waiting for this moment since June
RominUwU		I shouldn't buy NU but wait for T?
RominUwU		but it isn't available yet
RominUwU		I wanted to full in T
vivek		after 2022 u would be buying T
RominUwU		before 2022
RominUwU		I might buy more NU and KEEP
RominUwU		Waw nice
Xkoyopa		Using metamask
Xkoyopa		Wrap to T with nu or keep
RominUwU		in my wallet?
RominUwU		I have just to hold NU or KEEP?
RominUwU		How can I get T ?

vivek		how can this be? this merge has been planned for nearly a year
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Coinlist got back to me to that their devs are excited for the transition and stay tuned. Coinbase gave someone a response that was a bit iffy/useless. My guess is it will take some time.
vivek		people still don't believe the merge is happening as evident by the nu-keep ratio
vivek		they should start announcing support

Ozgur		Thank you
MrsNuBooty		There is no reason we should expect the price to drop, imo.   Everyone here would have a very different answer for this though.  We have a channel dedicated to price talk and speculation, we need to move this conversation to <#870383905314832395> but I‚Äôll answer here since a couple have similar questions.  All 3 assets ~if valued by the market correctly~ would have a value that could be calculated to a T but when markets don‚Äôt behave rationally it will create arbitrage opportunities.  I expect the prices to rise simply because there is an opportunity open for the market to repeatedly take.  <:takemymoney:902180195396628490>
Ozgur		Hello guys, please clarify, if many people convert to T will the price of nu and keep drop for purple that don't convert?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		ü§£ ü§£  brain freeze!

user42731		So if we get 4.78 t per keep and t what is to stop keep price dropping a huge amount after t launches ....... will keep and nu become untradeable on exchanges etc once t is live ? If not t goes live we all trade our keep / nu for t  then keep and nu price plummet üòÜ

MrsNuBooty		Definitely not to my knowledge
kingdomlaw		If they are selling it‚Ä¶ that seems bad.
Xkoyopa		Probably someone from marketing guild
kingdomlaw		Just curious, I just saw Thresholdnetwork.crypto domain was listed on OpenSea. Being this close to merge, should we be concerned? Or coincidental? Or just someone trying to take advantage of launch?
maclane		It just stays in the vending machine contract
pixel_21		If you wrap your Keep/Nu for T, T gets listed on cex, and you then decide to sell some of your T directly on a cex. What happens to the keep/nu token that was originally wrapped?
Mic		ok. I think noobs like me should just hold KEEP in wallet. It's like a jungle out there, no idea how to maximize on your holding üòî
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		I think, you don't stake in the vending machine. It is only used for coverting NU/KEEP to T token.. staking T is something diff is that right <@405654833131945984> ?
Mic		can I get the link for vending machine to stake T Tokens?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		That depends on your risk tolerance.. hard to answer that since we have diff approach on the market
Mic		if you had keep would you stake it as insurance backstop for more KEEP OR wrap KEEP and use the vending machine to get T tokens?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		No, im just ur average degen aping in to cool stuff
Mic		just your opinion
Mic		thanks for explanation, you are much smarter than me. So is the risk very low, low, medium, high, or very high?
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Thats ur risk for staking in coverage pool
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		At least thats how i understand it.
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Liquidated ETH will be auctioned for tBTC, if no buyer (ARbers) then covKEEP will be used to buy tBTC in open market then took the auctioned ETH.
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Signers bond their ETH and overcollateralized bridge BTC (for tBTC) by 150%. if ETH/BTC pair tanks and the collateral goes 101% then the signers ETH will be liquidated but signers keep the BTC.
Mic		so there are only 2 options for single staking it seems 1) Stake KEEP as insurance backstop (don't know how risky this is) 2) Stake KEEP...wrap it to get T tokens in vending machine
Mic		yeah i guess.
maclane		Smart contract risk, price risk, slashing risk to name a few
Mic		hmm, what can that be unless the whole project goes bust? I've been staking literally 10 coins/tokens for over a year with no issues. KEEP has a unique staking mechanism and my little brain can't figure out the risk. But I also hate that KEEP is just sitting in my wallet, I rather make it work because i'm a long term holder
maclane		Staking anything definitely has risks‚Ä¶
Mic		thanks...i did read for 5 mins...then got lost. I understand staking (no real risk), I understand farming/pools (risk is impermanent loss), but I don't understand the risk level for staking KEEP as insurance....
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Kinda hard to digest at first but its  worth it.. makes your decision much more clearer.
¬∞ Zk_Ingsi ¬∞		Here you go bud! Have fun! Youll love it.... I hope üòÇ https://docs.keep.network/tbtc/

kudo94		Hey, as East said, there is no need to rush with the exchange, it can be done at any time. Gas may well fall to 10, for example, as it was in July-August
kingdomlaw		Low gas days, are still high fees on ethereum lol I don‚Äôt really care much for myself, fine with the fees even if annoying. More so worried about small amount holders. Like 1k or less. Who may just decide to sell instead. Especially ones that aren‚Äôt on here and understand the process.
East		2 comments on this:
1) it‚Äôs like farming, you pick the low gas days to do it
2) those not willing can hodl on their existing tokens and do it any other time, there is no hurry
kingdomlaw		With it being a smart contract vending machine, between erc-20 tokens, what will be the most efficient and inexpensive way to exchange the KEEP and NU? Or are we just expected to pay to the high gas fees? If so, won‚Äôt that disincentivize holders to use the vending machine and in turn selling the KEEP and NU and causing a dip in price?
NU4lyf		UGH
NU4lyf		ugh
Vict0r		see <@!824233374704861195> 's explanation
NU4lyf		what about 2021 T
Xkoyopa		After council is elected and token factor finalized, the council can vote to  fund the vending machine
Vict0r		the proposal vote is likly going to pass in thee next few days (NU)
Xkoyopa		Both voting for Council members & Nu inflation halting proposal end tomorrow
NU4lyf		<@!698554030523285535>
NU4lyf		when should that be done
Vict0r		<@!317331606165520397> because there are steps that need to complete first, such as halting of inflation, finalizing of conversion ratios etc.
Mic		ohh ok. ty
NU4lyf		why
Vict0r		that information isn't available
NU4lyf		i need to know
Vict0r		no exact date, should be very soon
NU4lyf		when available?
Vict0r		<@!466633085790978058> the vending machine contract is not yet available
Mic		where is the link to wrap KEEP to get T Tokens?
DirtMetazenn		Gotcha. Okay. That helps a lot guys. I was under the impression that the older tokens could still have certain use cases and I might regret converting (all or some) early on. ‚ÄîAlso big fan of the project and what ya‚Äôll are doing. Ever since I first heard about NuCypher‚Äòs PRE & FHE, I was on board. Very excited about what both teams are going to accomplish. Thank you and happy new year everyone ü•Ç
maclane		the use case for nu and keep is essentially to upgrade to t. unless you want to stake nu and keep to run the legacy apps, which wouldn't make much sense since new ones will be deployed on Threshold
DirtMetazenn		Awesome thanks. That‚Äôs definitely a relief. I could definitely benefit from seeing others‚Äô examples first.
East		The idea is that all the action is on the T side of things.... so unsure if it makes sense to hodl on Nu/Keep instead of wrapping and getting T.
DirtMetazenn		Thanks. That‚Äôs reassuring. Is there a benefit to continuing to hold Nu vs Threshold? Is there anything breaking down the future use cases of one token vs the other?
East		Just continue to hodl.... we're getting Guides for every step of the wrapping process. When that's in place and there's some experience with the whole process you could jump in. No hurry.
maclane		The ratio is fixed forever, if you wait to upgrade it is ok
DirtMetazenn		Anyone willing to answer some potentially dumb questions over dm? I‚Äôve owned most of my NU for close to a year (and as of a few months back bought some KEEP as well) but I‚Äôm not staking or anything and unsure of the steps I should/need to take for this merger. I‚Äôve just hodl‚Äôd mostly due to being hesitant about gas fees, taxes, and afraid of making a mistake that could cost me too much. If I don‚Äôt use the vending ‚Äúmachines‚Äù to convert to Threshold within a certain time frame do I lose the opportunity for the 3x 4x exchange rate or do I have plenty of time? Should I convert some, all, or none? I know that we‚Äôre supposed to be able to convert back if/whenever we wanted to, but I just don‚Äôt understand some of the implications and what all this means for me. 

I have ASD and I can read and read on something(which I have), but sometimes with unfamiliar subjects until it‚Äôs broken down for me it doesn‚Äôt all fall into place. I know I‚Äôve missed out on staking and putting this investment to better use, but I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how I should proceed. I invested not to make a quick buck, but because I believe in this project‚Äîand I would love to have a better understanding. Anyone willing to help would be appreciated.

tejaposh		üëç
Mic		appreciate you taking time to talk to us. Alot of us are kinda lost.
wexsider		To my understanding, starting December 31st you should be able to wrap your NU to T (if you want)
maclane		I'm the ceo of the development company that contributes to nucypher, but not the ceo of nu üôÇ
maclane		https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-council-election-nominations/121/44
sunny shaikh		When?
wexsider		You would need to wrap it
tejaposh		Are you the CEO of Nu
tejaposh		<@405654833131945984>  why are you not in the council members list?
sunny shaikh		If i have nu coin in any exchange 
So will it automatic change or ?
East		Soon enough there will be a new dog-sheriff in town ! üòâüêï
Xkoyopa		gas fees
homeless		Will there be any fees for wrapping?
NU4lyf		will the wrapped nucypher token count towards the supply of the nucypher and t token?
maclane		It‚Äôll either be on stake.nucypher.network or the Threshold dashboard or both
danio		I don't like metamask..
East		You probably best using it with Metamask like most people!
danio		Will I exchange to T through this KEEP dashboard if I have a Binance Chain Wallet?
Xkoyopa		How about Nu? Anyone?
willthesis		For Keep it is here - https://dashboard.keep.network/overview. There will be a new section to support wrapping into T
Xkoyopa		Where are the token dashboards(sorry if this is a stupid question)
willthesis		Not on metamask directly but you can use a web3 wallet to interface into our token dashboards to complete the wrapping process
Xkoyopa		So wrapping will be available on metamask?
maclane		If you want to use T on day 1, the only guarantee is to manually upgrade. I assume exchanges will want to support but we can't guarantee anything and they will all have their own internal timelines/priorities
Pink Unicorn 777		Wow. So should I move my nu and keeper to metamask? Where will the exchange take place?
derek		We (NuCypher) have gone through a few of these and a startup at a much earlier stage is where the real value of these type of accelerators get unlocked - determining product/market fit, access to dev/biz resources, initial traction, funding etc. As <@!405654833131945984> mentioned the incentives for the advisors are more along the lines of gaining access to emerging early seed-stage startups to fund for the upside.
MrsNuBooty		We don‚Äôt need funding obviously but I think the resources provided could be extremely valuable to expediting our growth though.
MrsNuBooty		I would like to politely say: I don‚Äôt think the DAO qualifies, it specifies founders.  Now a brand nu merged network with awesome founders, sounds like those guys qualify.  üòè
maclane		The advisory/mentors panel is a bunch of VCs so I anticipate they are targeting pre-launch/seed stage applicants for their deal flow
maclane		But if you or someone from the DAO wants to engage and participate in the program, I'd say go for it
maclane		my guess is this is targeted towards super early stage projects (e.g. a couple people with an idea). I think Threshold could easily have a higher market cap than several of their corporate sponsor partners üòÜ
Xkoyopa		They have not announced listing the T token yet. Also, another community member received email from coinbase support regarding the question stating that they do not have a mechanism in place to perform the swap to T.
Pink Unicorn 777		Will the T token be on coinbase? Could I just swap into T on coinbase?
Pink Unicorn 777		thanks. When is this set to start? Coinbase won't do this automatically?

OhmaGa		So.....do we have a halt Nu inflation proposal yet?
daviemurray88		Brilliant. Thanks
Ryan C		asking for a friend üòÜüòÜ
East		Hey, rn you would have to tell your friend to stay tuned to the announcements. Cex like Coinbase might support users with the wrapping process. It's really their decision. They could facilitate the way for upgrading the tokens to T or it could be that you will need to follow the wrapping process everyone else follows, by doing it outside the exchange.
daviemurray88		What happens to the average Joe with a couple of thousand sitting in coinbase. No wallet... will it be a simple transaction...asking for a friend üòÇ
Xkoyopa		Thanks for clarifying üôÇ
Agoristen		Technically staking rewards for KEEP (tBTC v1) will continue throughout March 2022 although the rewards are known and minted upfront so inflation will in fact be frozen.
Agoristen		or somewhere in-between
Agoristen		Vending Machine Contract Deployment & Activation is estimated as a 2 day job, starting December 9th. Launch might be 11th of December.
kudo94		December 9 is an approximate date, there was no news of the change in dates
Xkoyopa		A tentative date of the 9th was given if I remember correctly (I could be wrong tho)
maximo3453		I don‚Äôt think it was ever said it would be the 9th exactly all I know that it‚Äôs mid December
Xkoyopa		Still shooting for the 9th? Or has it been pushed back?
maximo3453		Sometime Mid December

Naxsun		Quoting MacLane:

Contracts are being deployed and the Threshold Council multisig is being created in the coming hours.

Once that is done, the newly elected Council will mint the initial T supply and fund the vending machine contracts.

Once the Council reaches a quorum of signatures for those transactions, everything will be live.

Bobooshka		Its rebounding now
roffett|MEKAVERSE		Hello mod, I just wanna know if I exchange NU to T, could I exchange T back to keep or only back to NU?
maximo3453		Nu or keep token will get you T token

Timi		Good project
willthesis		Haha timing definitely worked out well. Let us know if you have other questions btw
nous		Ask and ye shall receive
nous		<@!777913547095146538> I promise I didn‚Äôt post that question just to set you up to be able to reply with the new website!
sooN		check <#870384195636199455>
Xkoyopa		Which website?
sooN		really clean, great job
sooN		did 2 scrolls on the website and i already like it
willthesis		All of the previous services from NuCypher and Keep will run on T. That means PRE, tBTC v2 and the random beacon are all moving over to Threshold but will continue to live as separate applications on the upgraded network
nous		Feel free to refer me to another source, if it is easily understandable
nous		I‚Äôd like to get a better understanding of how the cryptography implementation works with T‚Äîas opposed to NU‚Äîbut from a very basic non-technical level. Does T inherit all of the cryptography properties of NU, or are any of the security protocols from Keep combined?
Ryan C		I think we'll see a revised timeline soon that should have that info, feel like NU Inflation halting shoudl be in the next few weeks
Ryan C		üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Isin		Just random thought, night night Thresholders! Night in China, hope you all well when you wake up hours later.
Isin		then it's December 9. I think the team may consider it is not proper time to launch the network since all the crypto market is crashing.
Xkoyopa		<@777913547095146538> said it would be discussed on Thursday's community call
Weedzy		<a:ohwow:577706688866418698>
Weedzy		Today new timeline release yes?
Weedzy		<:Shrek_WowThere:883619760150036500>
Xkoyopa		Server is pretty DED lately lol
Where all the Thresholders @?
Xkoyopa		Any idea when Council Election will take place? And DAO vote to halt inflation?
kudo94		hey, we are waiting for updates from the team. For now, focus on this timeline: https://medium.com/@keep_project/a-provisional-timeline-for-the-threshold-merger-7593d5cb3771
sunny shaikh		What is the date of strom

I mean mergerüòçüòçüòçüòç
sunny shaikh		Hello 
Sunny shaikh from PAKISTAN 

I love this projects
Xkoyopa		Thursday?
willthesis		I don't want to commit to anything there so we should just wait for the community call to discuss the updates
Xkoyopa		So does this mean no live vending machine on Dec 9?
willthesis		No eta right now on that but there will be a threshold community wide call next week with updates üëÄ
Xkoyopa		
Naxsun		This was for a call about a month ago
Naxsun		There is no poap to be claimed
Kosisochukwu2		Am not able to scan
Kosisochukwu2		Can someone drop the poap code
beccazican		ü§∑
Naxsun		Ah haha. Not sure I recall that. I think that was referring to how to actually get the poap afaiküòÑ
beccazican		Not necessarily utility. Just whenever they announced them and were talking about them, it was with "stay tuned for more on these poaps" and then thats all I know about them baha
beemeeupnow		Next the bots will say 'wen POAP' üòÜ
willthesis		It's probably bot accounts left over from the treasury task force and integrations hangouts earlier. We put the calls on events for the first time and there was interest in POAP distribution
5iveby5ive		Anybody else not hear anything in the hangout?
Xkoyopa		Evolving use cases! What's up Threshold'rs

https://twitter.com/dltMOBI/status/1468276356911968276?t=UsO1mKeMjqi-VGpHCvL2aQ&s=09
willthesis		Ie if you have a lot of POAPs from different DAOs it shows you are contributing or involved with web3
willthesis		One thing might be onchain DAO reputation
beccazican		Other than "souvenirs", what will be able to utilize poaps for? (If anything)

Xkoyopa		Has not been confirmed yet but you can join tomorrow's community call on the hangout channel at 3pm est for the newest update on the launch timeline.
zaffadaffa		Hey, im new too, i was just wonder when does T go live? Has that been confirmed yet
Evandro Saturnino		Certainly docs and guides will be available soon we have more information on the wrapping contract. We will have more information regarding the merge on the community call tomorrow. Stay tuned
Augustus31		<#882289615959121990>
pixel_21		Hello everyone, new to the discord here. Is there any info out there as to how we will be able to swap our Nu/Keep tokens for the new T token once it's launched? or is that TBD still

What will happen?
Naxsun		
MrsNuBooty		I can‚Äôt hear you, speak louder!
Naxsun		Hah. It's still Degen doing the dustribution though so probably they meant that
MrsNuBooty		Oops maybe my listening is impaired ü§î
Naxsun		afaik it's still not posible to distribute through DMs but only through the 'claim command' way. Did a quick test in Tally.
MrsNuBooty		What the heck?  This is awesome!  https://youtu.be/xCigYNydsyc
khanny123		No problem
reversing		Great, thanks buddy!
khanny123		Should know after the community call tommorow
reversing		A few hours later?
reversing		When can I convert my Keep to T?
MrsNuBooty		Because you can mint POAP to Ethereum and there is a market on Opensea‚Ä¶ I think the POAP floor was like 0.05 ETH last I checked
OhmaGa		But what is there to gain? Why make bots? I don't get it
MrsNuBooty		If we say the amount of time, we get gamed.  It‚Äôs a ‚Äúreasonable duration‚Äù üòâ
MrsNuBooty		I was on a POAP call a couple of days ago and they said DEGEN should be üëçüèª now!
willthesis		Inflation on either network has not stopped yet but it is still on track. We are discussing this process in more detail at the call tomorrow
Chrispy		I still need to get a tree up üéÑ
Chrispy		did the inflation stop when it was supposed to? Haven't been keeping up on the github blog

Prepping the network launch, contracts , vending machine.
Things are moving. 
Stoked AF!
OhmaGa		I think it was 15 mins but not 100% what they set it at
Chrispy		what's minimum? like 30 mins?
OhmaGa		Me too
East		We just hope degenbot works
OhmaGa		If you're on the call tomorrow for the minimum duration of participation you'll get a dm from the degen bot with a link to claim your poap
CryptoScam		Thxs, Just searched on Google. I'll be less dumb tonight
OhmaGa		Proof of attendance protocol
CryptoScam		What is Poap?
Larry TableTennis		üëç üëç
Xkoyopa		As of now there are none. Maybe hear more about it on tomorrow's community call @ 3pm est.

MrsNuBooty		I am the delay in the notes guys, I super apologize!  I will get these done soon.   My oldest kiddo is unexpectedly moving off 2 weeks early and leaves tomorrow so we are enjoying a bit of family time and then I promise I will get them out.
arty		Did I miss something?
Xkoyopa		Nu -> T -> Nu ‚úì
Keep -> T -> Keep ‚úì

Nu -> T -> Keep √ó
Keep -> T -> Nu √ó
hiolleh		Is T -> NU also possible?
A*		Of course. Nobody knows for sure how the market will react. You're asking questions that cannot be answered right now
hyunwoo		As far as I know the conversion rates for Nu and Keep to T tokens are different and that conversion is not compulsory. Could this part have an impact?
A*		Stakers can continue staking but instead of earning NU they will earn T
hyunwoo		The worrying part is that if a lot of that quantity comes out on the market, won't it have a different effect?
hyunwoo		So, I wonder if, by maintaining staking, a large amount of Nu will be released into the market by unstaking the Nu that has not been released to the market.
hyunwoo		Thanks for the explanation
hyunwoo		The profit that Nu's holders get from staking and the resulting Nu's impact is also insignificant, but I am aware of it.
A*		Currently NU total supply is increasing. Why? Because stakers are earning NU token rewards. To stop inflation means NU total supply will stop increasing (inflation will stop).
hyunwoo		If rewards are received after lock-up of staking, will the rewards of Nu and Keep coins also be converted to T?
Xkoyopa		Protocols mint tokens for rewards(staking, etc.) This inflated the asset by increasing supply.
hyunwoo		In conclusion, does the conversion to T tokens take place on the last day of this month or something similar?
hyunwoo		What does stopping inflation mean? In crypto exchanges, transactions occur every day and prices fluctuate due to supply and demand or more. Do you mean just reducing the ascent?
maclane		Does that make sense?
maclane		For stakers, inflation/staking yield will move from NU to T
maclane		Once inflation in NuCypher ends, then it will be possible for people to start upgrading to T.
maclane		I believe there are some notes in progress.

You can see the updated timeline that was shared here.
hyunwoo		I'm not good at English, so I hope you can understand why I'm asking a question through a translator.

Any idea what it means to stop inflation on Nu?

I knew that the merger of T would be difficult today,
but I was expecting to stop staking Nu and inform you of the schedule for converting Nu and Keep into T tokens and a wallet that can be converted.

The staking rate is considered too high compared to other cryptocurrencies. I think it is going around inflation or other problems. Did these parts come up in today's call?

And I'm sorry, but I'm from Korea, so I was sleeping when I called the content. Of course, even if I heard it, I couldn't understand it, but can anyone help me organize the content? Or is it organized and can be checked in any space?

As I write using a translator, the content is strange and difficult to understand, but I hope you can help me. thanks
Adrian Lee		wow
DEGEN		Account verification is temporarily turned off. Please reach out to support with any questions.
maclane		poap farming or something idk

Alisha		Forget it.
Alisha		I keep listening over 10 mins.
Xkoyopa		Bots
Chrispy		Were you in the call listening in for at least 10 mins or did you just hop in and out like a live frog into a frying pan?
Alisha		I did it,but doesnt work.
Chrispy		Its cleverly named ‚Äúclaim-poap‚Äù
Chrispy		You need to type the command in the channel with the bot
Chrispy		Why are people still marinating in VC? Is there a beatbox competition or something I‚Äôm missing out on?
A*		Unfortunately I missed the meeting due to work obligations. Will an official announcement be made with all the updates?
IA3G		That is great to know üëç  much appreciated üôÇ
maclane		If you mean they need to spend gas money on weekly commitments, that ends with inflation. They will not bleed ETH.
Alisha		I join the meeting
Alisha		I use poap claim platform: DISCORDÔºåbut it doesn't work.
IA3G		Is the current expectation that nu stakers will be happy to slowly bleed eth for the greater good during this period?
Or will the <:lightpurplethreshold:907191983649464320> reasury get involved to redress this?
Alisha		How can I get poap?
Alisha		/poap
OhmaGa		Okay, ty
maclane		Yes, that‚Äôs correct
DEGEN		POAP claimed using `/poap claim platform: DISCORD`. Thank you!
Agoristen		Yes
kudo94		Hey, no, APY will increase. There is also a 21-day withdrawal cooldown.
shoegazer69		I'm curious about the impact on the KEEP coverage pool with the release of T and the vending machine contracts.  I find myself wanting to withdraw my KEEP, is it a concern that the coverage pool takes a big hit because of many folks doing the same?
zemini		oky
kudo94		hey, price discussion only in <#870383905314832395> thank you
zemini		set T sell price high ‚Ä¶.forthrt abt keep and nu convrrtt all to T
JP		Trying to make sense of the Keep => T transaction history. Was the code written to wrap 1000x the amount of T as the first transaction (if you look at mrsnu.eth, it's exactly 1/1000th the amount of the wrap before that)
JP		Not that it matters, but small typo on the test wrap site - "for for"

aaron0		‚ùì üëâ does anyone have an easy way to pull the historical price of KEEP token into a spreadsheet? I am looking for the historical price per day, each day from the beginning. something like the google finance function inside of sheets would be awesome... feel free to DM if you have ideas or suggestions üôè
YellowOwl		when we will be able to stake the T token alone?
Naxsun		Hey Simonüëãüèª  If you want to convert (wrapping) now, you'd need to do it through a wallet that can interact with the wrapping interface or contract, like MetaMask or similar, yes. 

But there is no hurry,  wrapping will be possible forever. If you wrap your Keep now, you will get the same amount of T as  if you would wrap in half a year.  

Over time there'll be more incentives for people to wrap to T, like staking, LP, Coverage Pools etc. This will make more and more people convert over time. 

Whatever works best for you, it's perfectly fine to wait.
simon43343		Should i convert my keep tokens that i have on Binance to T true metavets etc?    Ore should i wait intill it‚Äôs possible to doe it in Binance ?  Thanks a lot Everyon fore the help// simon sweden:)
MrsNuBooty		I did this with the v2 wrapping guide for YT just to see if more people stumbled across it and looking at stats: 12% of the pages views have come from the YT search function, while only 1/5 of the videos are loaded with content tags.  üëè  All great feedback, I completely agree we need to focus on seo.
willthesis		That is fair! But also - Saddle has been 250k per week for this whole time. It switched pools recently because of the pause on the v1 metapool. Nothing has been proposed by community yet so communication is happening well in advance. Once again if you want a say in the convo you can join the treasury task force hangout as per <#899020401718493285>
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		<@!410212090289192960> <@!139551375825567744> a place to muse about the ops questions about which we were conversing at the Kenwood house: 

https://github.com/threshold-network/threshold/issues/1
willthesis		Correct
TheArtfulDodger		you can also view them via the poap app on ledger live
vivek		Give me one too plz even tho I only have keep
OhmaGa		Idk how it works these days but I remember back in the day you could just put a ton of invisible text on the bottom of your page with key searches. Like everything you could think someone would type to find your page
MrsNuBooty		If you were one of the first 100 wallets it was already delivered, it is on xDai so easiest to view it from your POAP wallet.
maclane		provisionally february
maclane		<@!687751150987903115> or whoever on the website management side is the best person to do some SEO polishing
BegYourPudding		Is there anything we need to do to claim it?
maclane		yep, this is something i've noticed as well. obvious in retrospect <:peepofacepalm:754852084414808144> 

we should probably juice threshold.network on the seo side with "T" "T token" "T network" "T crypto"
ehsan6sha		Can we have a meeting with NuCypher team if time allows? üòÑ
willthesis		This will be discussed in more detail tomorrow at the Treasury Task Force sync. Check <#899020401718493285>
East		What Naxsun said, there isn't a schedule. Allocation changes are proposed, discussed and voted.
maximo3453		Any update or time when staking contracts will be deployed for T?

I‚Äôve been getting dmed by several people on twitter and discord about this
OhmaGa		Like, maybe someone should work on the google algorithm to bring threshold.network up in the searches for "what is T?" and "what is T? Crypto"
OhmaGa		I realize it will stand out for people just scrolling through exchange listings but searches kinda suck. Like if someone finds T on an exchange and searches "what is T?" I'm sure they're gonna have a hard time figuring that out
OhmaGa		I guess there's a TUSD that's TrueUSD lol
OhmaGa		Its mostly for tickers
MrsNuBooty		To be fair even NU has 4 other coins that pop up before it half the time and they have letters that follow the nuxx
MrsNuBooty		I‚Äôve been able to find it by continuing on with spelling Threshold.
OhmaGa		One big downside to naming the token "T" is it's not very friendly in searches. It not being specific adds a lot of noise around it in results
MrsNuBooty		Threshold should be listed on LunarCrush this week for social insights! <a:emoji_26:912200997458305045>
danio		say hallo, haloo
Minh Tran		Beautiful üòä
Naxsun		There isn't a schedule per se. These are the current weekly allocations, until a proposal to change something on this passes

- 170k KEEPs as an incentive for those who provide liquidity to the KEEP/ETH pool in Uniswap
- 250k KEEPs as an incentive for the Saddle tBTCv2 metapool
- 50k KEEP per week for the KEEP coverage pool
Naxsun		Yeah these week they are double. Next week should be normal.

But allocations are on a week by week basis so there could be changes in the coming weeks if proposals for this pass.
East		Shame is paying out so much money of the DAO on a pool !
East		https://www.tbtcfarm.info/pool/saddle_v2_migrate/

NecroJap		such a shame how the APY dropped by 240% in 2 days
eci		Hi I have T in my trust Wallet.  Is there any advice on how best to hold or stake this.   My only options are to send abs receive
Chrispy		Probably Will or Maclane
Goldberg | StakeSquid		anyway gm and happy new year everyone and I think I love everyone who is excited about nu and keep anyway
Goldberg | StakeSquid		ai... just bought some NU on OKEX at .60 ... got my incentivized testnet rewards back. and came here to look for what happens next. I can wrap it I can sell it and I can get some more it seems eh? but I'm actually looking for products. tBTC is a good start but I was hoping there is more to play with soon now that the merger is complete.
zemini		yes i have doing it i have started dca from .63
Monregi		Why? U can buy cheaper
Dr.HM		can we convert back T to NU?
zemini		wrong time of mergerüòÇüòÇ
Naxsun		Oh nice! Is there a template that you can share and we can fill in? A lot of the work being done is a mix of community driven and core teams, so we'll likely collab on this as well
Naxsun		Congrats ser
unit0001		not sure why figment added that maybe to drum up business
john_packel		You can wrap to T anytime you want. You may want to do it by the time rewards shift from KEEP and NU to T but that‚Äôs probably a few months away.
pixel_21		Hey guys - why is it recommended to swap to T tokens by end of Jan?
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Coinlist update:

‚ÄúYou are receiving this email because you are currently participating in Nucypher staking on CoinList. 

Nucypher is planning to upgrade into the Threshold Network in February, which will impact upcoming staking rewards and transactions. Following a Nucypher DAO vote (more information here), NU staking rewards will halt across the network in preparation for the upgrade. 

Here are important updates regarding your NU Stake on CoinList:


You will not earn any rewards for NU staking on CoinList in January.


You will not be able to unstake your NU until withdrawals from the staking node are made available by the Threshold team (approximately February 23rd).

You will not be able to transfer or trade your staked NU prior to withdrawals being enabled by the Threshold team.

Your NU will be safe and will not be available following the upgrade period.
Any unlocked or unstaked NU can be traded or transferred during the upgrade period. This freeze only impacts already staked NU.
Once withdrawals from the staking node are enabled, you will once again be able to transfer or trade your NU.

Over the coming weeks, we will have additional updates on Nucypher's migration to the Threshold Network including how to convert your NU tokens to Threshold tokens (T).
 
We apologize for the inconvenience during the migration and upgrade period.‚Äù
Vitan		Probably the team dose not want to pay exchanges for listing the coin, ( saving a little bit ).  They waiting the exchanges to list the coin by itself.
willthesis		Yes. The Treasury Task Force call notes are here - https://forum.threshold.network/t/notes-treasury-task-force-weekly-calls/163/7

Integrations Guild call notes should hit the forum soon.
Sammy675		Was there any minutes taken
Naxsun		Oh actually I'm wrong, there is new initiative for a weekly twitter spaces on Wednesdays as well, 8pm ET
Naxsun		I believe the closest upcoming call will be the T-party (marketing guild call) on Thursday 3pm ET
Naxsun		Check out <#899020401718493285> for upcoming events
Naxsun		There were 2 calls earlier today. Treasury and Integrations Guild. No more calls today afaik
Sammy675		Is there a call today
vivek		But When tbtc 2.0 tho team?
vivek		yes
paul üá´üá∑		(just for information, I'm a young french, I've seen a lot different project, but for the first time, I feel that this one is a good one. The community around KEEP and NU seems very strong. Your project is very interessant and have real potential and utility to me
paul üá´üá∑		Maybe tBTC will attract wBTC users ? Is it one of the goal of the Threshold network ?
paul üá´üá∑		I have never used it personally but I have posted it here for information
john_packel		Has anyone here used Bilaxy? We are questioning whether to mention this one in the newsletter or not.
danio		now people are watching, waiting for development, as soon as it appears on the stock exchange somewhere, it will be a revolution for T that will not be stopped
maclane		I personally would benefit from exchange discussions staying in <#870383905314832395> so that I can keep it muted
paul üá´üá∑		https://bilaxy.com/trade/T_ETH
john_packel		Who is going to benefit from that?
vivek		I'm just sharing my opinion so others could benefit from it
john_packel		Calm down. The sky is not falling. Quite the opposite: We‚Äôve just completed a historic merger and launch of the foundation for privacy in public chains, we have tBTC v2 and other exciting news coming, and both the teams and community are working very hard. How might you channel your energy to something positive?
bubbleoseven		right, but it's extra steps which most people won't commit to. I hope exchanges will allow easier way of doing this in the future
maclane		you can use any web3 wallet
bubbleoseven		People don't want to use MetaMask  to wrap
MrsNuBooty		Another wrapping guide is now available from Figment! <a:aaw_yeah:780882115305799710> https://twitter.com/figment_io/status/1480953121627115528?s=21
MrsNuBooty		Vivek do you do drugs in your free time?  Take this üí© to market! My patience is running low with you! <a:emoji_52:912202885775908905>
CryptoScam		Need incentives for holding T rather than Nu/Keep
vivek		probably would have been a great idea if it got listed on CEXes with those numbers, but evidently no exchange wanted it
vivek		The volume on T was almost 0 too when I checked
vivek		We know and that is a disaster
A*		Only around 3% of keep has been wrapped and less than 1% of nu. <@414604822616997899> is probably right
zop1997		Great job <@850117720573214730>
MrsNuBooty		I‚Äôm not familiar with any projects that were listed on any major exchange the week that they went live.  I would suspect that we need to give exchanges a bit of time and they are probably keeping an eye on how many T are in circulation.  I suspect you can‚Äôt launch an asset on a CEX without a certain threshold of liquidity being met.  I am no expert on any of this though.
vivek		<@!414604822616997899> what are your thoughts on why not even a single exchange that is good has listed T after a week+?
MrsNuBooty		Nous (of the T Marketing Guild) just finished this awesome explainer video, can y‚Äôall show it some love please?  https://twitter.com/thetnetwork/status/1480943104547069954?s=21
paul üá´üá∑		Hi, I have several questions, I know that the KEEP network and the NuCypher network will merge, and that inflation will stop for NU and KEEP tokens (their emission will stop?),
- But will they still be used in the DAO threshold? Basically, do I still support the project by holding my KEEP tokens? 
- And also from a speculative point of view, will they continue to appreciate in price?
- Finally, what about the investors (Coinbase Venture, a16z Crypto, Polychain Capital....) will they also turn their KEEP tokens into T token or will they stay on KEEP?
Thanks
Paul
kudo94		Hey, you can convert for T at any time, for example, gas is cheaper on weekends
PEAJANMAL		insane gas fee for wrap $T
PEAJANMAL		idont wrap now yet
PEAJANMAL		fucking gas fee 100$
PEAJANMAL		i got it already
Naxsun		fwiw just tried myself in some wallets and worked without issues
Naxsun		Yeah. This is not on the NuCypher / Threshold side. I'd reach out to MetaMask for support
PEAJANMAL		10 mins past till now
PEAJANMAL		this contract
PEAJANMAL		yea

[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Will probably take a bit for exchanges to help switch over, This is a major first in crypto
weseegzp		This is a very simple and clear situation
weseegzp		Without the trading platform, there is no liquidity, and no one is willing to exchange a token without price.
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Thank you all for helping take the brave leap with threshold in 2022! Paving the way for many of us newbs üôÇ
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		If i am following that right
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Might be an alternative to coinlist one sides nu staking if their new threshold in feb/march staking is much lower apy
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Sounds neat please keep folks posted

CouchPusher		These are just some comparisons, certainly not comprehensive (and I left out other YF and LYF protocols where you can get maybe 4-5 digit % APY but your token is being inflated to infinity‚Ä¶.)
CouchPusher		And if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have at least 32ETH, you can stake ETH and earn ~5%. However, it‚Äôll be locked up indefinitely until eth 2.0 is live. Or you can stake eth on lido wrapping into stETH and earn around the same APY of ~4-5%.
CouchPusher		For reference staking curve gives you low single digit percentage and you need to lock up up your CRV for 3-4 years.
CouchPusher		Some of the examples listed in the snapshot have used 8-10% APY
CouchPusher		Sorry, misspoke, not 30%, it‚Äôs still tbd but it depends on the staking % of tbtc v2 and PRE protocols
CouchPusher		They had a snapshot a few months ago on this. Inflation expected to be ~10% and a ‚Äùstable yld‚Äù if I remember correctly of ~30%

https://snapshot.org/#/nudao.eth/proposal/0x1f2863968999103564fcb74161aaae4a9040e46662de267bb43ced94ca9bf40e
Swolepoke ‚ÄúFinal Boss‚Äù		How much T is enough T
Mic		thanks, any idea the apy/apr would be?
MrsNuBooty		The ‚Äúvending machine‚Äù is a smart contract to exchange your NU or Keep for T.  The contracts are live, vending machines funded and a beta UI is live for upgrading at stake.nucypher.network/wrap.  Nous from the <#900823201045704784> made this great wrapping guide - https://youtu.be/ySFk0olAJpM 


The staking contracts have not been deployed yet.  Stay tuned to <#870384195636199455>  for the latest progress and updates.
Mic		is the so called vending machine live to stake keep to get T? if not, whats the eta?
MrsNuBooty		The ü´ñ love applied here üëá https://twitter.com/nucypher/status/1481335537877221377?s=21
East		Maybe you want to be here ? https://curve.fi/teth/

Anyway, T only staking will be available on Coverage pools soon tm. And we're aiming at something like Tokemak, which would allow you to provide one sided T and earn on that. But it takes time.
YellowOwl		but would like to know if we will be able to do something with just the T token soon
YellowOwl		Thanks!
Im gonna provide liqudity  with my T token tomorow on uniswap v3
Evandro Saturnino		https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/threshold-network-token
YellowOwl		can you give link, i cant find the token on coingecko by just typing T
MrsNuBooty		What have you done with Vivek?
vivek		This is pretty good now
East		
East		https://curve.fi/teth/
vivek		U can buy T directly on uniswap but not recommended
vivek		By buying KEEP and wrapping to T
kin		How can i buy t token?
vivek		But no reason to hold them when the staking goes down for them
REZZ4NS		Most of the other points are redundant, the token is not even a month old so obviously it's going to lack liquidity/holders/users
vivek		Worthless as in technically. The value should still be what they are worth in T
vivek		Keep and Nu will be worthless in like 4 months. Everyone will convert to T
Richeza		It's very open answer to my question
REZZ4NS		Everything that runs on keep/nu and gives it value is being migrated to T.
Richeza		I still can't understand what incentive for holders to exchange for token T
is it implied that the threshold product will have more users?
And how will liquidity flow, how will it be stimulated?
Richeza		I can't understand what will happen with keep/nu after change to T
I mean keep/nu have liquidity and every token has value
after exchanging my liquid tokens, I receive a weakly liquid token T, but what happens to the coins that I left in contract
we get deflation on Keep/Nu coins and inflation on T token
Can u explain me?
YellowOwl		cant find it on coingecko when typing just T
vivek		People should convert and wait.
vivek		It‚Äôs on coingecko. Uniswap but low liquidity
YellowOwl		also where is the T liquidity? cant find it on coingecko or uniswap
YellowOwl		when we will be able to stake the T token alone?
vivek		<#870383905314832395>  it will be volatile as exchanges announce support
arj		Where is tBTC liquidty?
keanu2themoon		Anyone else wishing this dip had occurred before the New Year so we could have forced some losses? Whew. I wish. I'm about to get forcibly bent over and screwed by taxes. <:bigbrainpepe:902498462371827722>
Pink Unicorn 777		Agreed. I have no idea.
maximo3453		<@!696152160966148157> üëÄ
CouchPusher		Super cool to read abt the beacon chain, EIP-1559 and roll ups that vitalik has been talking abt.! Not shilling ETH here but it‚Äôs something to pay attention to esp when thinking abt the amt of liquidity that could potentially be pulled into eth from btc.
CouchPusher		Yep, I‚Äôm brainstorming something more formalized like a sub stack or medium post with all the information. In the meantime a great source that is public for everyone to check out is eth‚Äôs quarterly report (as of 3rd quarter 2021):

https://coinyuppie.com/ethereum-2021-q3-quarterly-report-eip1559-nft-l2/

The metric I referenced is what eth reported as ‚Äúbtc on ethereum‚Äù (4th from bottom). There‚Äôs a little more than 19mn btc already mined so the ~1.5% of btc on eth pulls from this metric.
paul üá´üá∑		Thanks for all these explanations, maybe you should write them down somewhere we can find them? Because it will be lost in the Discord...
East		So I don‚Äôt really, so if you're up to it pls do the research. Kind of curious how those number look rn
CouchPusher		but then to your point, you guys have the data, so would trust that over whatever DA has üôÇ
CouchPusher		https://dune.xyz/queries/7081 this is a dashboard i found on renBTC daily volume (not wBTC)
CouchPusher		someone probably created a dashboard for this data on dune analytics as well
CouchPusher		i would assume so yes. think cmc reports with/without fees volume somewhere in their dashboard
East		So bridging (which is what gives us fees) would account for a % of that number. We can probably crunch a potential number from the defipulse btc on eth graph.
CouchPusher		not that i know of. the footnote to their 24H volume is just simply what's been scraped from the exchange. i'd note that the way CMC aggregates volume may also included a market pair, so think ltc/btc or any other derivation, so this double counts some of the volume.
Fishhook		Thanks I missed that comment
East		https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/931264029287133184
Fishhook		Lots of communication has gone on with the merge and the voting. Let us know how and when we can stake in Threshold. I am eager to invest and stake. I‚Äôm
East		Although these number look good, I'm not sure that you can extrapolate the wBTC traded number (the 24H volume) as pure bridging/minting operations or they also include mostly trading against other erc20's, is this explained on Coinmarketcap ?
Mic		cool, thanks for sharing
CouchPusher		50% capture of wbtc may be conservative, or optimistic. who knows, not going to say i know what the capture rate will be but the #'s above are just for illustrative purposes
CouchPusher		i'd say lastly, if you wanted to put hard numbers to just wBTC (and I may be wrong on #'s but using coinmarketcap:)

a) daily 24H volume is ~$186,621,903, which at current btc price (~$42,860) equates t ~4,354 BTC traded per day.
b) run-rating this to 365 days bc crypto trades 24/7, that's 1,589,210 BTC transactions per year, or ~$68.1bn of transactions per year
c) let's assume that tbtc v2 eventually replaces 50% of wbtc annual volume, that means annual trxns of ~$34.1bn (this is just a guess for argument's sake)
d) I believe for every wrapping trxn, they're expecting ~50bps (0.5%) of fees, so 0.005 * $34.1bn = $170.5mn of fees per year. 
e) also i'm not including renBTC and others like sbtc, they all have their own trading as well.

you can value the future stream of cash flows over the next 5-10 years and come up with what you think what T is supposed to be worth. i think the upside is massive esp given the price today at ~13cts. I believe Will shared a version of annual running cost to support the marketing/integration/treasury guilds so you have your expenses there that you can build out P&L and arrive at cash flow.
vivek		good to hear!
willthesis		Staying away from hard dates but staking should be ready soon. tBTC v2 is making great progress. We can share more detail on both soon
vivek		when news about staking and tbtc 2,0
Mic		got it. Thanks for explanation üôè
CouchPusher		i mean, you're now seeing institutional money flow into BTC at an incredibly rapid pace. the next step, imo, is that institutional money gets more educated/comfortable with BTC/blockchain and want to start interacting with other protocols, mainly on ETH other alternative L1s. BTC has Lightening and (i think) ETH plasma as L2 , but the options are very limited w.r.t. protocols built on top of BTC atm. ETH as the main L1 now and alternative (AVAX, ADA, SOL, ATOM) have an incredibly fast and developing L2 ecosystem built on top, and the value proposition to BTC investors (now) is to help them bridge over to these other L1 without giving up / selling their BTCs. i think this is incredibly valuable.
Mic		it feels the main source of value for KEEP are BTC holders, not much other coins
CouchPusher		what do you mean without btc? like if it were to go away?
Mic		but still dependent on Btc. It's like without BTC there is no value for KEEP
CouchPusher		no, that's not the only application. the use case above is tBTC
Mic		Is KEEP's only real use case is to let BTC owners operate on Eth ecosystem? Kinda one dimensional
CouchPusher		Nu has direct applications to a few industries (healthcare being one, and HC spending in the US was ~$4trn in 2021, ~16% of total US GDP) so it's a fairly large end market that you could see stay on web 2 and use or move onto 3 and partner wtih. it's a unique KMS (key management system) where granting/permissioning sensitive private data can be done safely (think genetic, healthcare, private sensitive data)

Keep - tbtc v2 is interesting bc it lets BTC owners operate within the ETH ecosystem without them having to give up/sell their  BTC. ~1.5% of BTC is on ETH last time i checked, and given institutional money's preference for crypto now (mainly BTC). There's a clear use case for it. main competition out there are wbtc, renbtc.
CouchPusher		yes. you can earn yield only thru T, not thru nu/keep.
REZZ4NS		Everything built on nu and keep is moving to T so that's where the value will be
Mic		how will wrapping help? more pools/farming oppurtunities?
Mic		I am comfortable with KEEP. Had it for a year and was staking it until it was shut down. Now with all these change I don't know the best way to use my KEEP to accumulate more KEEP or another token
REZZ4NS		Buy keep and wait for exchanges to support the wrapping.
CouchPusher		can't provide advice to ya bc you ultimately have to choose based on your investment horizon/risk appetite/thesis, but what each of the options mean:

#1 + 3: hold onto your nu/keep and wait it out. the "uncertainty" here is just timeline, not plan. vending machines/contracts are all live, it's just the staking contract that's TBD. #3 just goes thru (what I think) are drivers around nu/keep price action. Not professing I know all ther reasons, but I "think" these are the main ones that are the main drivers.

#2: you aren't comfortable with the timing uncertainty and you sell your nu or keep and move on
Mic		thanks for post. I'm going to be honest, for non-tech noobs like me this is overwhelming. I guess the simple question would be, if you can accumulate KEEP, Nu, or T - which one would it be? And best approach to accumulate it?
CouchPusher		my post was in response to your q fyi
CouchPusher		If you're thinking from the pov of an indifferent investor, the the price at which a Nu holder will choose to stick with Nu and convert is when Keep prices are ~46.67% above Nu, because while the 4.78 T conversion ratio may seem more favorable, you're giving that favorable conversion ratio up by buying Keep at a much higher price. At this point when I'm writing the post, Nu/Keep prices are trading virtually on top of each other, so one could argue if you're bullish on T that you can sell out of Nu and convert into Keep and capture some arbitrage in the prices. This is, of course, not factoring in any fees you may pay on CB when you're trading in and around coins (anywhere from < 1% to 2% depending on how much $$ you've parked in CB pro. don't know what it is for binance).
CouchPusher		3) you can keep your nu/keep as they are today, but some dynamics you should understand for the time being:
- a) everything is trading / pegged to btc right now, so whatever price action you see on nu/keep, just pull up BTC and you'll see the charts are virtually identical
- b) KEEP has been shilled actively in the telegram group given its more favorable conversion ratio (i.e. you get more T for KEEP) and so there may be minor price movements there, but as someone in the telegram chat mentioned, the prices of Nu/Keep are virtually trading on top of each other atm bc of the uncertainty around timeline to staking contract enablement, potential listings on CEX (coinbase/pro, binance, etc.) and partnerships with other layer2 protocols to improve liquidity/product offerings
- c) ~50% of Nu circulating supply (i.e. 632mn of the  ~1.37bn) are staked and locked up so there is very limited trading there as well. The option tree one would think for nu holders are: 1) "once my stake unlocks, presumably when the staking contracts for T go live, should I convert directly from Nu to T?" or 2) "once my stake unlocks, should I sell my Nu and buy Keep bc of the more favorable conversion (4.78 for Keep vs. 3.259 for Nu) and then convert to T?"
CouchPusher		the way i see it in terms of how I as a coin holder would evaluate my options through different decision trees:

1) if you choose to convert Nu or Keep over to T today, the liquidity for T is pretty thin and you'll likely experience some impermanent loss, i.e. the price of T is more correlated to the price of Keep rather than the combined Nu/Keep prices * their respective token conversion rates * their respective circulating supply (though the ratios are set and post-conversion to T, your exposure really becomes the price of T). This is in comparison to liquidity in Nu/Keep are relatively "developed" in that they're available on most CEX and dex should you want to trade in or out. 

2) the merger closed ~2 weeks ago and efforts by the team are ongoing in bringing online the staking contracts. Staking contracts allow Nu/Keep holders who have already converted to T to begin interacting with the new T ecosystem to provide liquidity with their native tokens and extract returns/value. However, the uncertainty around the timeline to when the staking contracts become live, putting it bluntly, is what I presume what everyone's worried about (i.e. many thought that the merger close would've enabled all these other services to become available day 1), which leads to unwillingness to convert to T or straight up selling out of Nu and Keep.
pantsme		silly goose
pantsme		<@456226577798135808> you messed up and spammed my alt üòÑ
CryptoScam		Nice punchline
YellowOwl		I prefer uni v3 because i can provide liquidity in range. For example T appreciating against ETH

And the yield should be bigger than curve too
Mic		im telling you for non-tech noobs this keep, nu, T marriage is confusing. No idea what to do with keep where you benefit the most
Mic		thanks. I honestly don't know what's the safest and best return on KEEP?
Pink Unicorn 777		Hi all, can someone help me with if the keep and nu tokens are still used? Should I sell them for threshhold?
Matt Luongo		There's no re-keying in the tECDSA implementation we're using rn, AFAIK
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		<@!469863531005739010> Some thoughts about your heartbeat-undelegation concept (specifically for tbtcv2, not v1):

I'm looking at <https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/issues/34> while on a call with some NuCypherino about how we handle, among many other things, stake validation for a given policy.

My question is: If a wallet loses members during its lifecycle, is there any mechanism for "passing the baton" to other members directly (other than at the wallet layer, eg sweeping to a wallet with more members, etc).

I'm wondering (in concert with <@!412679128316379137>, <@!139551375825567744>, <@!410212090289192960>): Does it actually make more sense for baton-passing to be Threshold-level logic (rather than handled independently by each application)?
Amitej		Awesome
willthesis		Haha. We should have an update with more juicy intel sometime next week <:emoji_36:912201679737348097>
Amitej		Hahahaha soon? Week days or months?
willthesis		Staying away from hard dates as is tradition
willthesis		Soon
Amitej		As I am.excited about T staking any hints when will it be? Tentative
willthesis		Yeah! Let me know if you have any other q's
Amitej		Great
willthesis		The website is pretty solid as is but I can pass this suggestion along to the team
Amitej		So instead of asking such questions I can find resources on T website
willthesis		What do you mean?
Amitej		What about the website thing
willthesis		Yes check the message above
Amitej		Can you list those sweet updates?
Amitej		One last thing why T website is updated with updates, resources and roadmap?
willthesis		There isn't a T roadmap. What I can say is on the horizon is T staking, full T dashboard, governor bravo for DAO, tBTC v2
Amitej		Better to wait for T staking
Amitej		One more thing where can I find T roadmap?
willthesis		You can stake Keep into the coverage pool. T staking is coming super soon so get stoked and stay connected with us here for more detail <:emoji_36:912201679737348097>
Amitej		Where can I stake Keep or if not then if I wrap it into T where can I stake it?
Naxsun		Yeah I think that would be a nice featureüëç
willthesis		<@!414604822616997899> also had some thoughts around this and further increasing visibility to tweets from other marketing guild members
East		I can set the Twitter bot up. With the feed of threshold, nucypher and keep accounts. wdyt ? Into a dedicated Twitter channel ?
Naxsun		I personally feel a twitter bot that auto feeds news from specific accounts or with certain hashtags could be nice.

And to have a central hub containing all the other info. I don't see a lot of benefit of then also copying that information into a Discord channel as well, since it's a lot of work to properly maintain and I think the Hub is easier to navigate. Maybe something like a 'latest news' section in the hub could be nice. The most important updates are shared here in <#870384195636199455>  as well.

Go to <#882289615959121990> and claim the role to see the marketing guild section, everyone is encouraged to contribute and bring in ideasüëçüèª
Amitej		I cannot see marketing guild section
Amitej		And where can I find T roadmap for 2022 based on Q
Amitej		Yes
Naxsun		We've discussed a twitter feed bot before, and within the <#900823201045704784> there's plans to set-up an overall hub where the most important resources as well as news would be covered
Naxsun		Do you mean to have a Discord channel where you can see the latest news on Threshold (twitter, media articles, blogs etc)?
Amitej		Keep and Nu news
Amitej		Can we add a channel on news?
Apolloüíé Shinohara		Ok
Apolloüíé Shinohara		How is the rewards so high for CRV?

Pink Unicorn 777		Agreed. I have no idea.

CouchPusher		Super cool to read abt the beacon chain, EIP-1559 and roll ups that vitalik has been talking abt.! Not shilling ETH here but it‚Äôs something to pay attention to esp when thinking abt the amt of liquidity that could potentially be pulled into eth from btc.
CouchPusher		Yep, I‚Äôm brainstorming something more formalized like a sub stack or medium post with all the information. In the meantime a great source that is public for everyone to check out is eth‚Äôs quarterly report (as of 3rd quarter 2021):

https://coinyuppie.com/ethereum-2021-q3-quarterly-report-eip1559-nft-l2/

The metric I referenced is what eth reported as ‚Äúbtc on ethereum‚Äù (4th from bottom). There‚Äôs a little more than 19mn btc already mined so the ~1.5% of btc on eth pulls from this metric.
paul üá´üá∑		Thanks for all these explanations, maybe you should write them down somewhere we can find them? Because it will be lost in the Discord...
Tazmon		Yes <@!931444329027866695> helped me with the issue. Everything appears to be working good now
kudo94		if it shows, then everything is fine, the tokens are in your wallet, maybe you just added the contract address in the metamask incorrectly
kudo94		hey, look at your address in etherscan, it shows T?
Tazmon		Help! I converted my Keep to T but when i click the "add to meta mask" option nothing happens. I have manually added the network in my wallet, why wont it connect? I did also notice the wallet ID in the corner does not match mine- it is the ID for the NuCypher token from what I can tell. What did I do wrong? Please tell me I can fix it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A*		Yooooooooooooo
maclane		https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/pull/2840 <a:eyesshaking:822169048317689907>
Weedzy		Ser we want nu crosschain pls ser
sinaking.pubg1387		Hmmm that‚Äôs not really that clear but alright. Appreciate it!
A*		Guys this is simple. Nucypher Corp. and Keep Corp. are 2 separate entities and teams. They had sex and Threshold Network is the result
maclane		i'm being concern trolled so calling it a night
maclane		they work for a different company
sinaking.pubg1387		Could you expand more on what you said regarding the keep team? Will Matt and everyone continue to work with your corporate entity?
maclane		there's a corporate entity that employs myself and other contributors to the nucypher codebase (and now threshold!), i'm the ceo of that
maclane		how the keep team fits is clear from my message above.
sinaking.pubg1387		He built his own crunchbase
MrsNuBooty		Click MacLane‚Äôs LinkedIn
MrsNuBooty		Who is assigning these labels?
sinaking.pubg1387		How will Matt and the keep team fit into this entire structure?
sinaking.pubg1387		I‚Äôm just trying to understand the dynamics and structure of this merge
sinaking.pubg1387		https://www.crunchbase.com/person/maclane-wilkison
sinaking.pubg1387		Why do you then claim to be a ceo across articles, crunchbase, and more?
maclane		Threshold is a network, not a corporate entity so there is no CEO nor the concept of a CEO. The Keep team is one of multiple entities contributing to the network, alongside the NuCypher team, the Marketing Guild, Integrations Guild, Treasury Guild, Council, hundreds of stakers, ~ a dozen staking infra providers, and many others
sinaking.pubg1387		Or what is keeps team, Matt, and their role in all of this?
sinaking.pubg1387		So it sounds like <@677292813603438653> will continue to be ceo?
maclane		Kinda like how Jack was CEO of Twitter and Square
maclane		Threshold CEO same as Bitcoin CEO.
danio		be with us! ask what you want here, you will surely get an answer
sinaking.pubg1387		Exactly I‚Äôm honestly a noob. But I did do my LinkedIn research where the base of my thought cam from but apologize if it came out a bit direct
danio		anyone can come in here, a lot of people do not understand and that's why they are asking here
sinaking.pubg1387		Just a question. Thanks for the response danio
TheArtfulDodger		I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm defending myself. Have a good night
TheArtfulDodger		Saying ‚ÄúNucypher‚Äôs team seams like trash‚Äù is absolutely FUD. Asking who Threshold‚Äôs CEO is shows his lack of understanding in what he‚Äôs even talking about.
danio		these are not FUD but normal questions
TheArtfulDodger		Lol dude chill tf out. That wasn‚Äôt directed at you. Jfc
danio		omg, write something smart
TheArtfulDodger		lol randos coming in here spewing nonsense fud
danio		I invest loyally in them, our time will come.
danio		they work but very slowly for such a large team, very large. Everyone here is a great specialist. I personally believe in them, but we have to wait longer. Do what you want.
sinaking.pubg1387		Nucyphers team seems a little less experienced‚Ä¶ What will happen to nears team?
sinaking.pubg1387		Should I be continuing to invest in Keep or threshold now? Who is the CEO of threshold?
Nikiel		Thanks! Sent a pm <@!847966010085998623>
billiboiadams		We‚Äôd love to learn a bit more about debtDAO

Quantitative Gambler		How can I claim Keep rewards from Saddle TBTC pool? I only see a ‚Äúwithdraw all‚Äù option on Keep‚Äôs website.
Isin		Hey team, any plan for a Threshold roadmap?
unit0001		Never share your seed phrases with anyone and never store it on any device that can connect to the internet. Lesson learned.
Mic		ok thanks
MrsNuBooty		A lot of questions being asked right now could be answered by reading ANY article that has been written about the merger.
MrsNuBooty		NuCypher‚Äôs network offered scalability for tBTC.  By merging the two protocols- Keep gained a more robust network and NuCypher gained bridges/primitives that will help with immediate network utilization.
Mic		What was the benefit to build T for keep?
MrsNuBooty		Keep is one of our two COR teams that build the T Network.
Mic		Why does KEEP need T and vice versa? If you can explain in basic terms.
JW		Dude. Wtf. If you have anything left there, get it off now.
maclane		If you shared your seed phrase with anyone then you need to remove any tokens in that address (and any other addresses derived from that seed phrase) immediately before the attacker does. If they have the seed phrase they have full control over it, so you should never use the address again.
kin		Thank you very much~
Naxsun		I'll report the issue with the banner on the website, thank you!
Naxsun		The difference between Saddle & Keep could come from APR vs APY here
Naxsun		The actual APY is displayed on the Keep dashboard https://dashboard.keep.network/liquidity
Naxsun		Ah I just see what you mean. That is not correct on the webpage
kin		Thank you very much. On keep network homepage, they say tbtc saddle pool apy 215%. but on saddle exchange, tbtc saddle pool apr is 28.12%. What's wrong?
Naxsun		In order to stake in the tBTC v2 Saddle pool you need tBTC v2..

With Keep only you could look into the Keep coverage pool
kin		No i just have keep coin...
Naxsun		I'm afraid there's no guide for that. In which step of the process are you? Did you already add liquidity on Saddle?
kin		Excuse me. How can i stake tbtcv2 saddle pool? Any youtube or blog?

Naxsun		I don'tüò¨ we could check with poap but probably quicker to do it manual. I can help and take a portion as well. As of Thursday, promoting Threshold to our youngest community members in disneyland atm
Nikhil		everyone upvote
Nikhil		https://zapper.canny.io/cointoken-request/p/threshold-network
milktruk		okay im first 100 how do i get poap?
zemini		how many holders on keep and nu
SephirothY_y		cann't wait!!!!
CouchPusher		
CouchPusher		100 holders I saw already
SephirothY_y		where to get POAP
kingdomlaw		Have we hit the 100 holders? Kind of excited about the POAP lol
Aulzon		is it possible to wrap keep into T, then sell T on the open market?
maximo3453		Mine was under 30 last night
Julesy		Not much that can be done about this
SephirothY_y		about $66
sem_owner_died		How is the gas ?
SephirothY_y		I'm 99th who have $T right now
SephirothY_y		wrapping keep to T is too slow
SephirothY_y		THX, bro
RedScott		Nice job
askar		check <#870384195636199455>
askar		0xCdF7028ceAB81fA0C6971208e83fa7872994beE5
askar		yeah im using MM
SephirothY_y		any one know the contract address for $T
RedScott		Yes. Although, this guide is using MetaMask
askar		thanks for the tutorial
askar		okay just wrapped some KEEP to T
askar		do i just fllw this
askar		in my wallet
RedScott		Have you got keep on an exchange or in a wallet?
askar		is there an article or tldr to explain how to get $T right now in exchange for KEEP
RedScott		I‚Äôm the first subscriber. Do I get more poap? üòâüòÇ
RedScott		Hang on‚Ä¶
Colbosky		that video above was a twitter video I believe
Colbosky		not threshold - but Nucypher does: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-BQfqCN2_Icg_0MGAvCd9w/featured
RedScott		Errrrr we have a YouTube channel?
Colbosky		
Colbosky		Congrats!
jeffrky		I got mine wrapped already and in my wallet üôÇ
Colbosky		https://twitter.com/TheTNetwork/status/1477457209491660804?s=20
Colbosky		now that is something to look forward to that is on a shorter timeline than say tBTCv2
Colbosky		I can't wait to hear what the "liquidity announcement" is
Colbosky		nothing worth doing is easy
RedScott		Everything‚Äôs always more complicated on a holiday weekend.
MrsNuBooty		Everything always turns out to be more complicated than I imagine
MrsNuBooty		üò≠
Colbosky		lol
MrsNuBooty		What if that means I just made people pay gas fees and we are already over 100 who have wrapped?
MrsNuBooty		No questions about why or who
MrsNuBooty		That might be the easiest and everyone can see the data at any time
Agoristen		Could make it the 100 first to wrap
Isin		Understood that some KEEP were pulled forward to LP incentives, but not like this kind of casual. Thought it was already fixed. We got stolen without even knowing it?
Isin		2m KEEP went into circulation yesterday, it‚Äôs not right according to the release schedule and pulled forward rewards. Giant circulation came from nowhere and just dump the market under this kind of trend, it‚Äôs unreasonable.
callq		Can discord create a reminder/alarm for me for this discord-voice-chat community call at 3pm ET?
Charlemagne626		Is there a bad time to do it?   besides when gas is high?

willthesis		@everyone jan community call is starting up now in voice
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Had an impromptu chat with <@!412648164710023168>, <@!139551375825567744>, and <@!410212090289192960> on this topic yesterday.

Here's my thing:

Consider that the basic political operations (I say "political" because these are operations required to maintain a Policy - something I assert is inherent to the cryptology of threshold cohorts which is distinct from non-threshold crypto) are common across applications.

If nodes in a cohort (or, in the case of DKG, I've begun to say `Clique`) begin to drop off and the integrity of the policy becomes threatened, there is a need to empower other nodes to fulfill those duties, ideally without Bob ever realizing that anything is amiss.

(A note on the way we've used terminology at NuCypher: you've used the word "rekey" as in cryptographic rekeying (eg, conventionally, a renewed key exchange, etc), but we use the word "rekey" to describe that piece of cryptographic material which allows a proxy to reencrypt - in the threshold context, where this is divided into fragments, we say "`KFrag`")
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Hey <@!231584498058395648>.  So good to see you on this side of the river.  How've you been?

Best regards
AshenOne		Sounds like there is no time limit for wrapping
Amitej		*holding keep
Amitej		Can someone summarize in layman if someone is holding T what they need to do if they don't wish to wrap it into T and will do it later?
AshenOne		Yeah.. that makes sense. Total supply will probably be around 9b! I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of wallets totally out of the loop lol
vivek		the team/foundation and VCs have most of the supply. they will convert within the next few weeks
AshenOne		But isn‚Äôt T used to run nodes or whatever?
vivek		this is not single asset staking
Isin		
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Probably not a question anybody can answer with confidence.  But this is also not a good channel in which to ask it.  Maybe take it to <#870383905314832395> or wherever your local moon lam-bros can be found.
Bobooshka		So is new proposal for T staking bullish for  NU or üêªish ?
Charlemagne626		I wanted to avoid buying more eth with fiat to pay the fees since the exchanges put a hold on funds...I'm still short.... Guess I'll hock an NFT
maclane		no worries <:peace:732186225410179113>
Charlemagne626		ok ... sorry for the stupid question the UI could use some dialogs
maclane		yes, the approval is a transaction as well
Charlemagne626		I was wondering why it was so cheap
Charlemagne626		the approval itself costs gas as well then right?
maclane		yes, you need to approve uniswap to spend your nu
DRAN		For keep to threshold exchange?
DRAN		Is binance added to the list?
Charlemagne626		It might have just been that?
Charlemagne626		hmmm is there an approval sign that needs to be done before the actual swap?
Charlemagne626		requested
maclane		or dm it to me
maclane		you can post the etherscan link to the tx if you're ok doxxing your address
Charlemagne626		hmmm well it said I was short on gas before attempting so I figured I needed more
maclane		so if you had enough eth to swap you should have had enough to wrap
maclane		fwiw, the gas fees to wrap is around (or less) than swapping on uniswap
Charlemagne626		I'm looking at it now just not sure what occured
maclane		i'd recommend looking at the tx on etherscan and seeing if things aren't what you expect
Charlemagne626		I have dms off lol
maclane		just a warning/heads up, you're probably about to get a bunch of scam DMs now
Charlemagne626		no
maclane		did the transaction fail?
Charlemagne626		I tried to uniswap some NU for ETH  to pay for some transaction fees on the vending machine and it just took my gas and gave me nothing, any clue what I could have done wrong?

jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Agreed, definitely something we don't want to block (application-level or other) deployment.  I'm starting to sketch out more medium-term thoughts.
Matt Luongo		Absolutely feels like a cross-network need
Matt Luongo		Apologies, my initial response was terse. What I meant was: I do think this is a broad need across applications, but one that we've taken an intentional shortcut around for the initial tBTC v2 release, especially as the initial low-level ECDSA implementation would be working against us. If we can get to a generalization for threshold liveness sooner across apps, that's fantastic... just don't want it to block
callq		Thanks but I don't see any events tab. (Desktop windows)
Xkoyopa		Wen threshold staking, lol
Naxsun		Ah not sure on that bot. Probably not update to date here since we're now all hanging out here. wen Threshold staking bot
Isin		
Isin		üòÇnoticed that the price channel of Keep Network shows 7 stakers‚Ä¶that‚Äôs my source
Naxsun		There's more than that https://allthekeeps.com/operators
Isin		Yes of course, got you.
Isin		Yeah, maybe some stakers unstaked, that make sense I guess. For now, Keep network has 7 stakers.
Naxsun		It's ok to verify and keep track of these numbers ofc, but if something is changing that you don't understand I would take a more investigative approach rather than assuming 'dumping' and 'stolen'?
Naxsun		I don't know the exact definition that CMC uses. There's lots of different definitions out there for circulating supply. Like maybe it's a staker that unstaked? How do they count the vending machine, coverage pool, AMM contracts etc

For example there's 60M difference between Coingecko and CMC in circulating supply
Isin		
Isin		No exactly transactions details, see it on CMC. Checking the Keep tokengrant address, not with my pc now. Just wonder where the 2m came out from? Not vesting tokens, not lp incentives, but how come 2m KEEP went into cir‚Ä¶
vivek		<@!845138976729727026> do u have the address for the keep that came into circulation?
vivek		wtffffff
Naxsun		This shouldn't be related to LP incentives. Maybe you could provide the transactions details?

OneRad1		That was definitely cheaper....Is there a step by step to wrap your Keep ?
Naxsun		I would expect so. Unless there's a big price difference in one of the assets across exchanges.
Naxsun		I expect so yes, but less. Last I saw on this is https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/870383405936820224/934256054324318219
Gaia		Will staking T require spending on ETH fees like staking NU did?
OneRad1		If you currently have NU on Coinbase, is the cheapest way to convert to keep is to transfer it to CB Pro, sell the NU for USD and then buying Keep with the USD?
Naxsun		Hey. Conversion from T to NU  can be done by interacting with the vending machine contract directly on.

https://etherscan.io/address/0x1cca7e410ee41739792ea0a24e00349dd247680e#writeContract
You would first need to approve the vending machine as spender on https://etherscan.io/address/0xcdf7028ceab81fa0c6971208e83fa7872994bee5#writeContract

It has to be done from the address that you used to originally wrap your NU.

Naxsun		Yep, check this message <@193865882621968384>
Zarathustra		Is the contract up for converting Keep to T?
Naxsun		What Kudo said, the original minted supply is 10B. How much of that will go into circulation will depend on
1) the qty that NU holders will / can wrap to T
2) the qty that KEEP holders will / can wrap to T
3) the amount of T that the treasury spends from the Treasury

If you want to know how much T 'can' be wrapped you'd need to look into the supply curves of NU and KEEP

Then there'll be staking of T. Depends if you see this as circulating yes / no.

Below you can see the holders of the T tokens. The %'s here are the % of the T tokens.
https://etherscan.io/token/0xcdf7028ceab81fa0c6971208e83fa7872994bee5#balances

The 2 largest holders are the vending machines. The 3rd one is the DAO treasury. The 4th one is the Curve T-ETH pool.
Naxsun		There will be a guide made accompanying that
Naxsun		To my knowledge there isn't yet. There is an overall interface in the works that I expect will allow you to wrap and unwrap through the interface
hoangloce		I want to ask how many coins are in circulation

If I'm understanding this right, there will only be signing and transfer costs ( & ongoing hardware ) instead of commits per epoch?
Xkoyopa		Obviously it is dependent on fluctuating gas fees but on average, how much eth per month to run a node
CryptoWalker		Ok thank you
maclane		there are no minimums for LPing or depositing into the coverage pool, but you have to account for gas costs
maclane		if you're looking for a more passive option, you can LP into the T+ETH pair or deposit into the coverage pools when they are ready. but staking in Threshold specifically requires running a node if you want to earn rewards
CryptoWalker		What if I don't want run a node but just stake T, is still minimum 40k?
Weedzy		You can wrap your KEEP/NU tokens into T ser, also you can swap for T through DEXs. Wrapping gives you more tokens tho'.
1NU = 3.259 T
1KEEP = 4.78 T

https://stake.nucypher.network/wrap currently a beta wrapping UI
hiAtreyu		Where can I buy or earn T?
taotao		KEEP was all bot price controlling. Opened by .5 in the beginning, now it is under .4. If you hold KEEP during the whole bull run, you even lost your money.
Naxsun		What do you exactly mean with a single sided T stake? Do you mean whether this is the only asset that is required to stake? The 40K is the proposed minimum stake in order to stake & run a node. So you'll need this 40K T, ETH to cover fees and set-up and maintain a Threshold node
Lowballer356		QQ for you.  Will the 40K T minimum stake we are voting on be for a single sided T stake?

hoangloce		I want to ask how many coins are in circulation
kudo94		Hey, 10B initial supply
You can see more details here: https://blog.threshold.network/threshold-launch/
hoangloce		Availble supply $T???
Adrian Lee		How r u today
danio		hi, this is a lot of your nationality - there is also a channel https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/899345233433722902
mjswag23		Is there a video or guide for unwrapping?
Orca		Do you hire Koreans?
Orca		Hi I‚Äôm korean
Naxsun		Not sure tbh. Only one way to find out üòÑ
OneRad1		Thank You, do you know if I have to add the Keep token into MM or just send it and MM already knows about Keep?
Naxsun		There's an interface + video made by Nous

Wrapping interface: https://stake.nucypher.network/wrap
Wrapping tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJOnWai4UzE
OneRad1		That was definitely cheaper....Is there a step by step to wrap your Keep ?
Naxsun		I would expect so. Unless there's a big price difference in one of the assets across exchanges.
Naxsun		I expect so yes, but less. Last I saw on this is https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/870383405936820224/934256054324318219
Gaia		Will staking T require spending on ETH fees like staking NU did?
OneRad1		If you currently have NU on Coinbase, is the cheapest way to convert to keep is to transfer it to CB Pro, sell the NU for USD and then buying Keep with the USD?
Naxsun		Hey. Conversion from T to NU  can be done by interacting with the vending machine contract directly on.

https://etherscan.io/address/0x1cca7e410ee41739792ea0a24e00349dd247680e#writeContract
You would first need to approve the vending machine as spender on https://etherscan.io/address/0xcdf7028ceab81fa0c6971208e83fa7872994bee5#writeContract

It has to be done from the address that you used to originally wrap your NU.

Could be personal ofc, but any particular reason you'd like to unwrap? Maybe there's a better alternative
kudo94		however, discussion of the market and listings in <#870383905314832395>
kudo94		hey, support and listing T is an initiative of the community or the exchanges themselves
lyj		Are you ask Binance for T swap support and listing?
investarge		Gotem
investarge		Hey
kashish		Thanks. Can you provide me resources to learn about the internal working of nucypher and threshold network? Consensus, communication, bridges etc 
Inorder to figure out a way to transition nodes from nucypher to t network, I need a good understanding of how both networks operate.
lyj		I have one question. After the merger, the developers of nu and keep will be integrated into the T project? Or do we do each project separately?
kashish		Thanks for your response. But I am required to submit my write up by next week Tuesday. I am expected to figure out how and when we transition nucypher worker nodes to T Network nodes.
lyj		thank you
OneRad1		Thanks
MrsNuBooty		Once all of the staking details are announced and it is live I am sure we will have tons to get people excited about. üòâ
MrsNuBooty		A good place to start learning about T is from the Threshold blog https://blog.threshold.network or on the Threshold HUB https://thresholdmarketing.notion.site/Threshold-HUB-14fe52159c55489b96091bce52e95830 Currently Uniswap and Curve are the only places I know of to get T directly.
OneRad1		It would also be nice for people who have never staked before to have a read me file that would get people excited to obtain a total of 40k T and what they can expect if they were to stake it....
OneRad1		One reason I ask is if someone has close to the 40k T that may be required to stake, it would be nice to have a how to to make up the gap someone is short
OneRad1		<@!414604822616997899> HI, where can we suggest more resources links? such as best how to to buy T direct?
MrsNuBooty		That‚Äôs great! As said above staking isn‚Äôt quite available but will be at the end of the month.  Please join us in the Marketing Guild and we will have a ton of help available to you.  Start by going to the <#882289615959121990> channel and react to the message from Will with the <:mrt:902188379498741820> emoji.

kashish		Hi I'm a master's student at ASU and as a part of my graduate service assistant position I have been instructed by my professor to write about "transitioning nucypher worker nodes to T Network worker".
I am new to nucypher and I would really appreciate if someone can help me get started.

Thanks
sbeland1		hi
MrsNuBooty		TMG is spreading rumors again https://twitter.com/tmarketingguild/status/1486095340541460480?s=21
C-Nu		Yeah...me too.  Not worrying about the daily ebs and flows of the market is why I prefer to invest long-term as well.  As always, thanks for the input!
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Im going to wait it out and see how close /greedy they are with apy before reconsidering options
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		And this locks it up a bit so i dont sell it
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Oh for me i like holding long term
C-Nu		Welp...I can't find the message (I'm not too tech savy with Discord yet)....so I'll try and sum it up quickly.  Basically, I mentioned that I have been staking NU passively on Coinlist since last April, and have no complaints on the process so far.  In reading your previous comments, it appears that you are in a similar sitiuation as me, and will have some decisions to make come Feb (once Coinlist unlocks my coins).  So I pretty much wanted to see what you were planning on doing?  I want to continue to support  the project, so will be wrapping to T (maybe swapping to Keep first depending on token ratio), and then wanting to stake T.  Figure the two main options are to (1) wait and see if Coinlist will be offering it, or (2) transfer coins to a wallet (ie...Metamask) and deposit to a LP pool (like Curve/Convex).  So I was just ineterested to get your insight?  Thx for your time!
C-Nu		That makes sense üôÇ  I'll see if I can find my message and post it here.  Thx!
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		I only know what I posted:)
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		I turn off dms for security
C-Nu		Thanks for the Coinlist info!  I am currently staking NU on CL as well, and had a question for you.  I DM'd you the question, but don't think you got it since we are not friends on discord.  If you get a chance, I would love to hear your take.
Nevergiveup		I don't have anything to hide, and I just wanted to speak openly about I see.
jakelynch		https://tenor.com/view/morgan-freeman-applause-clap-clapping-bravo-gif-16910851
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Discussions about the _value_ of T or the constituent tokens, in terms of how the work provided by nodes creates economy and how the ecosystem of users can optimize it, are fine.

Discussions about the _price_ of T or its constituent tokens are a different matter and are not welcome here.  We got no patience for FOMOs and pumps, no chambers in our hearts for moons or lambos.  We just.  don't.  care.

And even if this stuff were on topic, does it give you no pause to consider that those of us who actually work on the network are uninterested?  That perhaps there are more important and pressing topics worthy of general discussion?

Let's keep this a space for inventing value, not hounding each other over how that value is priced.
maclane		that's the second reminder today btw, so I know you are aware...
maclane		<#870383905314832395>
Nevergiveup		NU? Like, are we allowed to give somone our own opinions  as to why Nu could be dropping in price in this room? 
Opinions?
Nevergiveup		Am I allowed to ask a question?
MrsNuBooty		40k T cost $3232 right now.  Are you suggesting the minimum stake size be higher or lower?
willthesis		There is a pass proposal on the governance forum explaining the mechanism. It eventually depends on what service you stake on. <@!407020249318424577> designed the mechanics and is the best person to chat with if you have more q's üôÇ

kudo94		hey, staking has not started yet, at the moment you can add liquidity to the eth/T pool on Curve
laozhou		helllo sir,where to stake my T tokens to generate profit?
maximo3453		Everyone please be careful and don‚Äôt ever do what someone tells you though dm. Scammers will have you connecting your wallet to fake contracts so always protect yourself

maximo3453		Alright Ill get back to glen and see what we can come up with
maclane		Almost definitely more than whatever their mins are I‚Äôd assume
maclane		There is a lot of liquidity for T on curve
maximo3453		I really like the one sided liquidity with no impermanent losses after 100 days which is a good option for T holders to get in a liquidity pool if they don‚Äôt have both eth/t
maximo3453		Yea I already spoke to a member of the governance dao and we chitchatted and I‚Äôm on top of that it will be in 2 weeks when glen and I will have another chat about it. First they want to see some liquidity for T which I expect once t staking contracts are deployed
maclane		<@!372997863061323788> had some conversations with them as well iirc
mrjohn420		i have enough bnt to make a proposal an submit it to the dao for them to reward us thats the goal a pool with no rewards kinda sucks

Naxsun		Sureüëçüèª
lyj		Thank you for the detailed explanation! I'll check more.
Naxsun		There's coverage pools, liquidity pools, staked tokens, tokens that are locked in the vending machine etc. Whatever you consider circulating will obviously have a big impact on the number
Naxsun		You can read more details on this here. https://forum.keep.network/t/proposal-pause-keep-inflation-to-calculate-token-factor-for-threshold/375
Naxsun		Inflation has been stopped on both networks. Keep had a different inflation structure in the sense that for Keep the total amount of tokens of 1B was minted at once, with different lock-ups and allocations. There were no new tokens minted after that.

I expect you are looking at circulating supply numbers? There's a lot of different definitions out there. For example there's a difference between cmc and coingecko  of 70M tokens. 

The total amount of Keep tokens that will ever be distributed  is fixed: 940,795,010 tokens. There is a remainer of 59,053,770 Keep tokens that exists but won't be distributed.
Naxsun		They will remain independent teams building on top of Threshold Network
lyj		And did the inflation of nu and keep stop? As a result of watching for a few days, the distribution volume of nu is fixed, but the distribution volume of keep continues to increase.
Xkoyopa		Any Meso-American Thresholders?

pscil		Wen exchange listing? Anyone reached out to any cex?
maclane		but probably they will all be wrapped in order to get T
maclane		but they are erc20 so ofc they will stay exchangeable. they are immutable and there's no way to shut them down
maclane		NU and KEEP become T
maclane		err... unsure what you mean by "real"?
orcogiocherello		Ah ok, so both keep and nucypher will still continue to be valuable and exchangeable. Isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù migration as a token from v1 to V2?
Xkoyopa		Interested in running a node but unsure of eth requirements...
Any round about figures and monthly gas fees to run a node
maximo3453		If you want T you will have to wrap it using the vending machine
maclane		later you'll also be able to deposit it into the tBTC coverage pools
maclane		currently you can LP it on Curve, staking contracts will be up in the next few days and you'll be able to stake T to run a PRE node (and random beacon, tbtc in the future)
Hich		Where can you stake T?
maclane		No
Hich		Is there a threshold whitepaper?
orcogiocherello		Hi, I‚Äôm not an expert. I would like to ask (sorry if the question could be dumb) what I have to do with my KEEP token. Do I have to migrate them? I bought them on kraken. Thank you!

mrjohn420		you have the balance of bnt to make a proposal an ive been trying to keep a pool for over  a year i talk to tyler an nate we need to coordinate is hard to reach quorum i promise you that you need all the help you can get ie bnt whales ok go it alone
maximo3453		Alright Ill get back to glen and see what we can come up with
maclane		Almost definitely more than whatever their mins are I‚Äôd assume
maclane		There is a lot of liquidity for T on curve
maximo3453		I really like the one sided liquidity with no impermanent losses after 100 days which is a good option for T holders to get in a liquidity pool if they don‚Äôt have both eth/t
maximo3453		Yea I already spoke to a member of the governance dao and we chitchatted and I‚Äôm on top of that it will be in 2 weeks when glen and I will have another chat about it. First they want to see some liquidity for T which I expect once t staking contracts are deployed
maclane		<@!372997863061323788> had some conversations with them as well iirc
mrjohn420		i have enough bnt to make a proposal an submit it to the dao for them to reward us thats the goal a pool with no rewards kinda sucks
mrjohn420		im trying to get us in bancor ive been asking nate an tyler for a year i wanted a keep pool bc i have a lot
mrjohn420		1 sec ago i wasnt sure if i did it right
Weedzy		<#882289615959121990>
Weedzy		You already had sir.
mrjohn420		how do i cliam a role

pantsme		<:pants:877578661157564446>
vivek		I think that is just the thing that can turn ur KEEP to T
Mic		i was told there will be staking for KEEP and reward will be T, I think it's called vending machine.
vivek		No, T to get T. KEEP staking will disappear soon after
CryptoScam		Great looking forward to it
Mic		Is this KEEP staking to get T rewards?
Naxsun		Expect news coming week
Naxsun		Soon ser
CryptoScam		When is T staking live?
kudo94		hey, <#870383905314832395> please
pscil		Wen exchange listing? Anyone reached out to any cex?
maclane		but probably they will all be wrapped in order to get T
maclane		but they are erc20 so ofc they will stay exchangeable. they are immutable and there's no way to shut them down
maclane		NU and KEEP become T
maclane		err... unsure what you mean by "real"?
orcogiocherello		Ah ok, so both keep and nucypher will still continue to be valuable and exchangeable. Isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù migration as a token from v1 to V2?
Xkoyopa		Interested in running a node but unsure of eth requirements...
Any round about figures and monthly gas fees to run a node
maximo3453		If you want T you will have to wrap it using the vending machine
maclane		later you'll also be able to deposit it into the tBTC coverage pools
maclane		currently you can LP it on Curve, staking contracts will be up in the next few days and you'll be able to stake T to run a PRE node (and random beacon, tbtc in the future)
Hich		Where can you stake T?
maclane		No
Hich		Is there a threshold whitepaper?
orcogiocherello		Hi, I‚Äôm not an expert. I would like to ask (sorry if the question could be dumb) what I have to do with my KEEP token. Do I have to migrate them? I bought them on kraken. Thank you!
willthesis		That is still the plan but the staking dashboard will intentionally ship a few days after to give time for q/a

jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		I made a new friend at a party last night, and part way into our conversation, when we were talking about our careers, etc., he told me that he had some NU and had heard about the Threshold token but hadn't taken any action on it yet.

Kinda crazy to have these encounters in the wild.
vivek		Right it‚Äôs one of the forks I see.
maclane		Olympus Pro isn‚Äôt the same thing as Olympus/OHM either, for that matter
maclane		If anything, they are rivals/enemies since he did a non-friendly fork

maclane		Olympus pro has nothing to do with Dani‚Ä¶?
vivek		Or am I reading the announcements wrong?

Vict0r		The Nu contract address can be found on Nucypher website
maximo3453		I‚Äôm interested in adding my t into curve anyone have any idea on how to do it?
maximo3453		Alright so you will go to the very bottom of mm wallet  and click import on your wallet. Custom token tab and paste the nucypher contract address and everything else will get filled up and just click add
beccazican		Yee I got that much...I just want to know I'm sending to mm correctly as I've just held everything on coinbase. Also, nu is not a searchable token on mm so I'd need to add the address but idk where to find it. No worry about the latter tho as I'm just sending keep

NateQ		Related question -- is there a link or wiki that details the motivations and thought process behind the merge, that goes into stuff like, what is the long term purpose and advantage of combining them? What is the reason? And what is the roadmap?
NateQ		Had a question about the long-term plan with all of this. Is the intention for the vending machines to remain active in perpetuity, even say years from now? So that there will always be KEEP and NU and T in circulation? Or are there plans to eventually disable the vending machines at some unknown point in the future, such that all holders of KEEP and NU will be required or at least strongly motivated to convert to T, because it will have features/abilities/characteristics that go beyond the two individually, or in other words is more than sum of its parts?

OneRad1		Hi, is there a step by step guide yet? It looks like I would transfer my NU to MetaMask, go to the website, connect wallet and upgrade to start wrap process?
Del		Shuffling through couch cushions for gas money üò∞
maverick31		I see. Let me try that as well
NuLypheStyle		You can add T to your metamask tokens by adding the T contract address to metamask. I think there's a place on the UI to add it as well.

I have a trezor but you should be able to add a token on ledger the same way.
maverick31		I guess I will wait for staking contracts to get deployed first and see someone else bring up the nodes
Xkoyopa		Lol
Xkoyopa		I agree
maverick31		Makes sense. Was gonna do the same but thought let‚Äôs ask someone first.
Xkoyopa		I tested the wrapping process with some smaller transactions to make sure it went to my wallet address before wrapping all of my keep
maverick31		Ok, thanks this is helpful
Xkoyopa		I can't answer that because I went straight from ledger to the Nucypher UI
maverick31		Scary lol. Does metamask show the balance?
Xkoyopa		I wrapped from keep to T with ledger.  The balance of my wallet address reflects properly on both the Nucypher wrapping UI and Etherscan but ledger live does not show my T holdings.
Xkoyopa		Keep in mind you will not see your T token balance on your ledger live...
NuLypheStyle		yes, any ERC20 compatible wallet will do
maverick31		Trying to prep for staking
maverick31		Is T token supported on ledger hardware wallet ?
maclane		most of us are north america, so just assume that time unless a specific time is otherwise specified üôÇ
NuLypheStyle		First lesson in crypto, always think in UTC. Disclaimer: I have no idea if it will be available 35 minutes from now or what exactly is happening at all.
maximo3453		It‚Äôs still the 30th here
paul üá´üá∑		of course, but I don't know the other ¬®¬®
vivek		I don't think that is limited to the French, multiple versions exist.
paul üá´üá∑		In french we would say : tout vient √† point qui sait attendre (Good things come to those who wait for)
maclane		Stop spamming or I will kick
vivek		it's already the 31st in some places
vivek		Is staking delayed?
Naxsun		Maybe this is referring to existing Keep stakers  (Or Nu) who can not wrap to T, for example because they're still staked and/or have lock-ups.

Those will use adapters, that gives them the staking weight on Threshold as if they were staking T using the token factors. These would be earning T rewards
https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/912344972005629983
keanu2themoon		Where did you hear that? I haven‚Äôt seen that anywhere, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense.
Mic		you are talking about a swap. I was told we can stake KEEP to get rewards in T token. can anyone confirm?
TheArtfulDodger		There will likely be still be required transactions, but less frequent
TheArtfulDodger		NU staking required a weekly on-chain transaction, whereas from what I‚Äôve read, the new process won‚Äôt include that, so it should be much less expensive
Xkoyopa		Yeah, but how much were(are) nu staking fees(eth gas) usually? I didn't stake nu.
MrsNuBooty		I assume it will be similar to the ETH fees paid with NU staking but we are all waiting to hear.  I expect to hear lots of info this week though, just hang in there!
Xkoyopa		Really want to run a node but need more info...
Xkoyopa		Can anyone give a roundabout figure how much eth it costs a month to run a T(nu/keep) node?
vivek		Why staking still not up yet? 1 day left
Naxsun		How much was given out as an incentive you mean?
Naxsun		It's already happening. It's opt in for a holder of KEEP and NU, so it's up to them when to convert. The T tokens were minted early January

willthesis		Yeah just need to wait a bit for the official intel. Once the contracts are live anyone can hard mode interact with them but it's recommended to wait for the dashboard for staking
vivek		so contracts will go live now and people can interact with it without the dashboard?
MrsNuBooty		No - a planned gap in releasing the dashboard so that there is an opportunity to get everyone educated and ready to spin up their node.
vivek		This means delayed?
willthesis		More detail on staking contracts coming super soon. There will be an intentional few day delay between when contracts are ready and the dashboard launching to ensure quality

willthesis		Np let us know if you have other q's
pixel_21		Ah, right. thanks will!
willthesis		This is for tBTC which is different than T. tBTC is the token name for our decentralized btc to eth bridge. v2 is being built on Threshold. T is the native work token for Threshold
pixel_21		thank you sir. Im assuming this is for anyone who hasn't wrapped to T yet?
willthesis		Yeah it basically means if you provide liquidity on the outdated / paused saddle tbtc pool you should migrate that liquidity to the new pool because the community is voting to end rewards on the old pool and move them to the new pool. We think the vote will pass

Vict0r		If you don‚Äôt trust MM, use a hardware wallet, like Ledger or Trezor. There are many others, but these above are all I‚Äôve used and would highly recommend either. You can still use MM with a HW, but you‚Äôll have that added security of being able to review and approve on the device before approving a transaction

OneRad1		Are you wrapping or just keeping you NU and Keep alone for now?
MrsNuBooty		I am not doing any of this myself just trying to explain what y‚Äôall were asking!
OneRad1		so actually sell all of the NU, then turn around and just buy as much keep as possible? Why not just buy T then?

MrsNuBooty		So what others are suggesting is selling your NU for KEEP and then upgrade your Keep to T.  So you would start by sending from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro as a step one.  Use the sell feature on PRO vs the convert feature on standard Coinbase.  Those fees the last I checked were rough for a swap.
OneRad1		Agreed, I try to at least use CB Pro
OneRad1		so if we wrap, we basically own T and if we ever want to sell we just sell it as T
MrsNuBooty		If you use regular old Coinbase for a swap they are going to rip you off
Mic		ok. I honestly dont know what makes sense. To wrap KEEP or swap it for T
OneRad1		Thx for the tax reminder....
MrsNuBooty		Keep will last forever!  (Maybe sleeping in the tombs of the vending machine but Keep and Nu will always exist)
OneRad1		wonder if it is better to move it to coinbase pro first
OneRad1		coinbase has a swap and it said 0 coinbase fee to move the NU to Keep, but maybe if I hit confirm it will show additional charges like gas
Mic		last question. Will KEEP still exist or we need to eventually swap it for T?
MrsNuBooty		Your spreadsheet looks good to me at a glance just keep in mind personal tax liabilities you might have for buying and selling
REZZ4NS		Yes you should swap to keep then convert to T to maximize T amount
MrsNuBooty		Outside of my purview üòÖ
OneRad1		so start with 5920.41 shares of NU and tried to figure out what best strategy was from there
OneRad1		The basis of the spreadsheet began with just the NU line and then calculated from that the other 3 lines
OneRad1		once finished you would either have $3,223 in T if you just go straight from NU or you would have $4122 if you converted to Keep and then wrapped
OneRad1		so does this look right if you currently have NU, you should covert it to Keep, then wrap it?
Mic		any ETA? Any info on APY?
MrsNuBooty		T staking isn‚Äôt live quite yet
Mic		I wrap Keep for T and then stake T?
MrsNuBooty		ü§© you did more HW than I‚Äôve done!!!! Love it!
REZZ4NS		Probs why he's interested in T
MrsNuBooty		So you don‚Äôt stake keep but wrap it in exchange for T and yes wrapping is live https://stake.nucypher.network
REZZ4NS		
REZZ4NS		Seems he supports encryption to protect against govt over reach
Xkoyopa		I know <@227997029140267010> isn't down with NSA dipping into NU/Threshold PRE lol
Mic		is the vending machine out where we stake KEEP to get T token?
MrsNuBooty		Like reviewing blogs and stuff before the MG existed!  It was our insider connection to Matt and MacLane when we had dumb questions <:takemymoney:902180195396628490>
MrsNuBooty		That used to be for serious stuff üòÖ

SuperMario		Hi does anyone know of projects building distributed CRM on top of Threshold?
REZZ4NS		Do an article we can promote with some questions
CouchPusher		But would be üí™üèª if there was one
CouchPusher		Could see a use case but I was told nu to web 2 partnership has experienced some push back
CouchPusher		Interesting someone at BLS is getting involved if true
MrsNuBooty		I believe so but I haven‚Äôt asked directly.  I did initiate the conversation by asking if he was interested in investing in the Threshold Network or was doing some economy research and he said both.
pixel_21		and finally tbtc v2 release
pixel_21		Does anyone know the general timeline for next steps? like staking, etc
CouchPusher		Does rusty*
CouchPusher		Is rusty work at the BLS?
danio		vivek drink more or high on good coke
vivek		Threshold launch was nice. When are we doing the next rebranding so we could hype it?
MrsNuBooty		I definitely need him to come write blog content with us‚Ä¶. üòÜ
MrsNuBooty		I feel dirty sharing private messages with y‚Äôall!  Seriously though what is my ask of him?  What is the coolest opportunity that this presents?

chandru		only god knows what MM does with all the collected info.

Fall_In4		Hi guys, do we know how long the KEEP stake drop last?
I was able to find out that stake drop happened on June 8, 2020

Vict0r		If you don‚Äôt trust MM, use a hardware wallet, like Ledger or Trezor. There are many others, but these above are all I‚Äôve used and would highly recommend either. You can still use MM with a HW, but you‚Äôll have that added security of being able to review and approve on the device before approving a transaction

zenbokoblin		ok cool. I'm interested in staking T in nodes
East		Staking T in nodes is also soon available
East		There is no rush to wrap your Keep or Nu, since vending machine contracts will be there like forever. T has a new T/Eth pool up in curve not yet incentivezed and soon T will get accepted in Coverage Pools
zenbokoblin		Hi sorry for being lame. I was out of all this for a while. I have KEEP and NU tokens for a while. Do I need to convert them to T tokens? Also, is there any staking reward for T?

Savant		anybody else getting a ton of crypto scammers hitting them up on discord? Starting to get annoying üòÑ
ehsan6sha		Sorry for long messages, just tried to share a semi-technical overview as short as I could üôÇ
ehsan6sha		Regarding the blockchain, as I said we aim to replace the cloud. An in-house developer team of n people cannot provide the whole cloud application suite. So Box has a staking module, which mints tokens and keeps for the users when they use a dApp, a portion of tokens goes to developers. Creating a sustainable way of monetization, without users paying out of pocket or being exposed to ads. Also IPFS is known as being slow, we addressed that with intro of local pools. Where I can join/create a local pool in my city and then in that pool we share CPU and Storage(basically decentralizing the same services we get from centralized Google servers) with each other again using Borg but can result in zero-net transactions if I share the same amount that I get from the pool. Also Borg is layer 3, meaning parent chain can be selected by the user, be it Algorand, Cudos, Polkadot, ...
ehsan6sha		We have 3 protocols (File Protocol, Data Protocol and AI protocol). Have built and MVP of File Protocol, now focusing on data protocol and encryption layer
ehsan6sha		developer imports graph library into their app and use a simple graph,sendFile for example to connect the dApp to backend. the rest is handled by us+libp2p (https://github.com/functionland/borg)
ehsan6sha		Basically running the full IPFS on end users device is what we think many were focused on. But there is no point for us to make the phone an IPFS node. so we are keeping the idea of having client devices(mobile phones) and server (this time a decentralized swarm, call it Box) building our protocols which replaces http with libp2p.
ehsan6sha		And this is the software stack(without blockchain part)
ehsan6sha		This is an alternative of Google Photos on BAS
ehsan6sha		https://github.com/functionland/photos
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		What's an example of a dApp using BAS that you can imagine?
ehsan6sha		BAS is the most wired of all lol we aim to not replace storage but the whole cloud apps(dApp server)
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		we've flirted many times with ideas that combine NuCypher + IPFS, NuCypher + ARWeave, etc., to make things that vaguely look like dropbox, or a distributed NAS, or something weirder
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Yeah, not sure who that is.  Maybe he'll have some ideas too üôÇ
ehsan6sha		hahaha did I just tag another Justin in my message?
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		So yeah, blockchain-attached storage
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		(which is fine; happens at least weekly üôÇ )
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		"had a brief chat" - let's be honest, you tried to poach me üòÜ
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Hey <@!812723631603580999> - glad you found your way here üôÇ
maclane		<@395042968802820097>
ehsan6sha		Hi guys. This is Ehsan from Functionland team. We are working on a project for replacing Cloud Storage and Service Subscription economy by introducing a new category of products, called Blockchain-Attached Storage (contains Hardware+Software+Blockchain). It creates value by auto-minting crypto for the users and allocating a share to the developers as well as supporting local pools where users share CPU and storage.  We just closed our seed round and got backed by Protocol Labs, Dfinity, Crust, Outlier Ventures and some other names in this round and through grants. 
We are developing a set of protocols based on Libp2p and had a brief chat with <@!809174977899266079> . Thinking of encryption layer, proxy re-encryption seems like an ideal case here, so wanted to get some opinions and collaboration. Would be thrilled to have a chat.

maclane		They can always be upgraded so if T has value, then they do too
maclane		NU and KEEP become T
gedi		So in reality NU and KEEP if not converted to T becomes worthless in timd
gedi		But what will happen to NU and KEEP all in all. I mean development will be stopped right? Because everything will be focused on T
gedi		Sry

RoadtoErehwon		I want my staked NU!
RoadtoErehwon		yeah its the final stage, but its taking its sweet ass time.
gedi		Or KEEP will get more expensive? Because conversion to T does not make sense with current pricing of NU KEEP and T
gedi		NU price should fall then it seems?
orion		I feel like council vote should've passed by now..not sure but doesn't usually take long..
RoadtoErehwon		back to KEEP.
RoadtoErehwon		the best part of this is that you can unwrap it later should you wish.
RoadtoErehwon		yes, buy KEEP on an exchange like CB, send it to your MM wallet, use the vending machine to wrap to T
gedi		Thats insane, because NU is more expensive now, but it's way better to wrap keep to T
RoadtoErehwon		https://stake.nucypher.network/wrap
RoadtoErehwon		you're better to buy KEEP and wrap it to T imo
willthesis		The first round of T staking release is just for PRE. It will be ready super soon along with a threshold dashboard release
gedi		Why not?
RoadtoErehwon		yes, but. I wouldn't.
RoadtoErehwon		if you had NU locked, it'll unlock early once the council's vote passes
gedi		Can I buy T already on Uniswap?
RoadtoErehwon		4.78
CryptoScam		Can someone please update me on T staking? Nu holders will be able to unstake anytime?
gedi		What about keep?
gedi		So it means, 3.259 T for 1Nu?
RoadtoErehwon		Yes.
gedi		Do I understand correctly that NU will be converted to T with ratio ~3.259
maximo3453		Looks like we are really close, just saw the GitHub channelüëÄüí™
zop1997		Wen starting rewards again.
shpoont		<@!414604822616997899> it would be great to have a written guide about staking and running nodes
NateQ		Why have rewards for the KEEP-ETH farm stopped? And the coverage pool as well... I thought we were still within the 2-week wind-down period?
jonson009		The space no poap?

jakelynch		lol so concise, i like it
RoadtoErehwon		sell on an exchange and buy keep
C-Nu		What is the simplest/cheapest way to swap NU to Keep?  Metamask?
BegYourPudding		Yes
benlongstaff		asymmetric information. please discuss in <#870383905314832395>
R1R		Theoretically KEEP should be ~45% more expensive than NU?
R1R		Why the prices of NU and KEEP not tied with the swapping ratio?
Hun_Zai		hello
Boster		ya thanks - i realized you can't unwrap to different asset.  Then what makes sense is just to swap NU to KEEP on binance, and wrap KEEP.  really no reason to wrap NU
Naxsun		They are never going to be worthless. The vending machine contracts will remain to be live. So if you hold NU or KEEP and you want to wrap them to T next year, that's ok. 1 NU will give you 3.259 T today, and will give you 3.259 T next year.

There is no time-limit. However, many people will wrap to T because this is where the utility is. Applications will be build on top of Threshold, and T is required to become a Treshold staker. Furthermore owning T allows you have a say in in Governance, provide incentivized liquidity, provide funds to the to be launched T coverage pools etc
Naxsun		There are 2 'vending machine contracts'.

1 contract to lock NU and receive T
1 contract to lock KEEP and receive T

Based on your wallet address, you can only unwrap the amount of NU or KEEP that you originally wrapped.

So say you wrapped 500 NU to T. That gives you ¬± 1629 T. You can only unwrap 1629 T to NU, from the address you used to to the original wrapping
Naxsun		Yeah, there will be gas costs
Naxsun		Maybe below articles are a good place to start:

Mint.		Can someone point me to a resource to explain why there's this keep nu threshold exchange
Boster		ya there's a guide in "market" channel - but requires using etherscan
BarZaTTacKs		Problem is there's no clear way of how to do that easily
Elon Huang		NU and KEEP will be out of circulatio, i guess the best way is swap NU to KEEP then wrap KEEP to T
Boster		haha possible
Elon Huang		cauz smart money is in the minorityÔºü
taking notes		Is NU and KEEP going to be worthless? We have to convert ? I've been holding my NU and KEEP on coinbase,  is it best to just sell now ?
Elon Huang		U need call smart contract to convert, so.....
dimpy		Can any1 tell me ??
dimpy		?????
Jdee		See I only have metamask and my NU on coinlist so new to all of this
vonsete		good morning from spain
dimpy		Hey when i connect my wallet  to convert my keep into t will there be any gas fee?
Boster		i'm giving free alpha, but if you wrapped NU to T before, you actually should unwrap it back to NU, sell it to KEEP, then wrap to T again
Isin		there is KEEP-NU pool on Uniswap
Boster		i think deposit is open
Jdee		Is there any way to convert NU to keep outside of binance or better to wait?
Boster		ya fair
anne.		perhaps
Agoristen		No benefit really until later this month. The inflation rewards won't start until then. See: https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/870384195636199455/939260098042286151
doo		anyone here?
doo		What are the benefits of staking t now?
LiL		Got it, thanks for detail explanation!
maclane		hopefully soon ü§û üôÇ
maclane		the current version of tbtc running on Keep has limited minting capacity. the tbtcv2 bridge that will be launching on Threshold fixes this, but it's not available yet
LiL		I can't deposit 5 or 10 BTC through dapp... it says not enough operators in the pool, anyone has any clue on this issue?
Bobooshka		Now that would be bullish for all 3 assets!
Hvc		great point
maclane		So if applications are successful and generate lots of fees this feeds directly into potentially reducing supply
callum		price discussion in <#870383905314832395> !! üòâüòâ
maclane		Afaik the most popular fee model being contemplated for Threshold applications is a buyback and burn/make/distribute to treasury model
maclane		Ofc, the DAO can decide to make the amount higher or lower, but it‚Äôs always up to token holders so non-staking T holders always have influence on the amount.
maclane		Under the current proposal inflation would only be 10% if all the supply gets staked (in which case no one gets diluted anywayüòÖ). Realistically, it would be some lower amount.
Hvc		what mechanisms or activities are envisioned that would reduce the supply of T, to theoretically keep inflation of 10% less of an issue to non-staking T holders?
maclane		Here, once T applications are live and T has good liquidity, the incentive to move across and stay is strong
Connor Martin ü¶Ñ		not much use rehashing it as the contracts are out already
Connor Martin ü¶Ñ		i agree the liquidity fragmentation is an issue for sure
maclane		Unrestricted two-way bridge splits liquidity across three assets
maclane		The goal is not only that, the goal is a design that encourages permanent upgrade to T
Connor Martin ü¶Ñ		i suppose there will be enough arbs to keep the market in balance, but thats a fairly small set of users. maybe its fine.
Connor Martin ü¶Ñ		so the goal here is to create price parity by allowing only the original stakers of KEEP and NU access to T arbs, and only in a value commensurate with their original wrap?
maclane		If the prices of NU/KEEP fall below the expected amount, they can be purchased, wrapped, and sold as T for an arb
maclane		If the prices on NU/KEEP pump above the price of T multiplied by the token factor, people that originally wrapped can purchase T, unwrap, and sell NU/KEEP for an arb
maclane		If you could unwrap arbitrary amounts of T this would quickly break since the supply of T increases over time due to inflation
maclane		Those token factors are frozen forever and never change
maclane		in the long-run, I‚Äôd expect NU and KEEP to track the T price multiplied by the respective token factors
Connor Martin ü¶Ñ		as far as i can see this is an incentive to *not* convert the original tokens, as the convert restrictions are likely to push the original tokens higher in value as fewer and fewer addresses have the ability to market sell via the unwrap function.
Connor Martin ü¶Ñ		So I just noticed that the `unwrap` function in the vending machine contract tracks the amount of originally wrapped tokens per calling address, and does not allow unwrapping any amount if the calling address had not wrapped it originally, and does not allow the unwrap amount to surpass the original wrapped amount. I find this pretty concerning, it seems inevitable that NU / KEEP will not keep parity with their exchange rate, as inflation rewarded to T stakers begin to grow the amount of T relative to the original tokens. Separate from that, it seems that it prevents any mev bots from arbing the tokens - which would further contribute to price divergence.

Isin		Bybit announced the support too, and T will be available on 18th! About one week earlier than Binance.

maclane		Can you expand a bit on the motivation to bridge an NFT *to* Bitcoin?

There are some teams working on NFTs using Threshold, including <https://twitter.com/Masterfile_co/> and <https://www.nulink.org/encrypted-nft-market> but more around access controls/DRM and not bridging.
Eldorado89		Just a question, is the team working on cross bridging eth based NFT's to BTC ? If you can get into the blue chip NFT to use the T bridge protocol it would def fuel the hype.

MrsNuBooty		I‚Äôm not sure I follow.  Liquid Keep and NU must be wrapped to T in order to be staked and earn rewards.
yzy		And I have seen many proposals on the forum page.  How can I know whether a proposal is passed or not
yzy		So both staked keep/nu and liquid keep/nu can earn the fees. So what's the differernce
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Update from coinlist:
‚ÄúYou are receiving this email because you are currently participating in Nucypher staking on CoinList. As a reminder, Nucypher is planning to upgrade into the Threshold Network in February, which previously impacted staking rewards and transactions.
 
Your Nucypher stake is now unlocked & distributed, and all previously staked NU can be freely moved:
Your previously staked NU is now distributed to your CoinList wallet
Your NU is freely tradable and transferable
Moving forward, you will no longer be able to stake your NU with CoinList
Over the coming weeks, we will provide updates on Threshold (T) staking and how you can participate on CoinList, as well as how to convert your NU tokens to Threshold tokens (T).
 
We apologize for the inconvenience during the migration and upgrade period‚Äù
TENFINITY		Good Day everyone

MrsNuBooty		‚ÄúT is an ERC20 token, so the process of listing it is standard. Exchanges are free to list it without any intervention, but we are happy to answer any technical questions you or your team may have.‚Äù - from Derek of the Threshold Team
MrsNuBooty		‚ÄúPlease do not tag users excessively‚Äù - it is one of only 5 rules that you agreed to 4 days ago when you joined our server. I will ban you if you continue to tag people as it disrupts their workflow and we have an entire community to answer your questions.

Kaito		I think this has gone into depth on pricing üòÇ, you can discuss further with others about pricing at <#870383905314832395>
khanny123		Or can T go up in price without nu and keep following?
khanny123		Wanted to also ask if T went up in price would that also mean keep and nu have to go up aswell?
khanny123		If they get delisted wouldn't the value drop massivly because they is no volume?
maclane		It makes sense to upgrade, if you want to participate in the upgraded network of course
khanny123		But is there really a point of holding nu or keep anymore since they are getting delisted of exchanges?
maclane		If you want to preserve the ability to unwrap for yourself, you need to withdraw and wrap from an address you control
maclane		If it‚Äôs from Binance‚Äôs address only they have the ability to unwrap
khanny123		What if keep and nu are a better deal and i want to unwrap to make more profits
khanny123		Thats unfortunate
BegYourPudding		I would assume you can‚Äôt unwrap
BegYourPudding		So that‚Äôs Binance, OKX and WazirX all aligning to (almost) the same timeline
khanny123		Does that mean i can not unwrap them back into nu or keep?
khanny123		And they automatically get converted to T
khanny123		So say i have my nu and keep on binance
khanny123		Guys
Boster		is there a way to check how much Nu or Keep has been wrapped to T?
khanny123		
East		
East		We made a graph that shows the whole thing:
East		that‚Äôs where you can wrap your keep/nu to get T <:purplethreshold:907191918516129842> and viceversa.
yzy		em what is the vending machine contract
East		They will stay around, but hopefully all locked in the vending machine contract bc all are wrapped to T. T is the work token for Threshold Network and is being used to pay work, operating a node, on the network.
nuinonnot		<@!415897491897057300> who I should contact for AMA or listing on CEX ?

MrsNuBooty		Here is a great step-by-step guide  - https://youtu.be/ySFk0olAJpM
MrsNuBooty		If you buy Keep then you own keep until you choose to upgrade it to T.   If you hold that Keep on a CEX then you will be subject to their terms, whatever those might be.
RapGamePatrickHenry		tysm ser üôè
Faeris		so if i bough 5000 USD of Keep i will also gain 5000 USD of T right?
maclane		The core of Threshold is a modular staking contract that supports different types of threshold cryptography applications
maclane		Here you go: https://github.com/threshold-network/solidity-contracts/blob/main/docs/rfc-1-staking-contract.adoc
RapGamePatrickHenry		So i've read up on Keeps and NuCypher individually. Does anyone have a good resource that explains how Threshold works? The blog posts are very vague and generalized, I'm looking for a whitepaper or the appropriate equivalent that explains how the Threshold protocol itself works.
llyrios		Would put some Keep down on the superbowl but HODL that boyyyy
llyrios		Not my girlfriend
llyrios		$KEEP is my valentine
Sammy675		Just looking at Etherscan, I can see the TX it‚Äôs starting to make sense to me know
Sammy675		Before it would show on my wallet
Sammy675		I had to add T to my Trezor
Xkoyopa		Yeah, you control the private key. Every erc20 token transaction can be tracked on Etherscan. My ledger doesn't show my T balance but the correct balance is reflected for my Ledger wallet address on Etherscan.
The T token simply hasn't been added to the ledger live app.
Sammy675		Ok thanks Maclane. Not into crypto too long so I am unsure with a lot of it.
maclane		Probably they have bad UI support for smart contract interactions
maclane		How trezor decides to display that in their ui idk
maclane		There is of course an on-chain transfer of the tokens
maclane		I have no idea re: trezor UI unfortunately
Sammy675		Is there any reason why I don‚Äôt have a received transaction on my wallet and only a sent transaction
askar		in terms of the merger, is the goal to eventually get rid of all KEEP and Nu tokens?
maclane		Depends on the gas price at the time you do the tx
Sammy675		I see, so its only one Eth spend transaction. And that it‚Äôs in my wallet it‚Äôs wrapped I have nothing else to do. I was just curious as the thransaction fee was quiet low only 18 Dollars. And I have read here that some are paying over 50 Dollars
maclane		You need to (1) approve the vending machine smart contract to spend your KEEP and (2) wrap the KEEP.

The UI combined those into a single ‚Äúapprove and call‚Äù tx
Sammy675		One more question. Is it just one Eth transaction to wrap keep. I thought I read somewhere That it costs two Eth transactions to wrap. One to wrap and one to send to wallet
Sammy675		I will check out that. Does that mean that I still control the private keys.  Was just wondering when it says I sent keep but no transaction for receiving T
Xkoyopa		Same with ledger.
Look at your wallet on Etherscan
maclane		Yes
Sammy675		Is that a reply to me
maclane		Sounds like you‚Äôre good then
Sammy675		But I do have T showing on my Trezor
Sammy675		I am not seeing received T
Sammy675		Got it to work. I have a question. On my trezor transactions it says sent keep. I have T showing up on my trezor but usually I see a received transaction when I get a token. Is this normal
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Any plans for us wrapping btc on algorand if we expand to other chains?
Sammy675		Getting Error string overflow
Sammy675		Hi when trying to wrap using Trezor through MM I‚Äôm getting a string error

benlongstaff		the top two are the vending machine contracts, third its the DAO treasury (currently held by the council), 4th is the curve T - ETH pool
RapGamePatrickHenry		This was extraordinarily helpful, thank you so much for your time
maclane		Yes, existing NU and KEEP nodes can become Threhsold nodes.

Yes, T becomes the governance and staking token for the network in place of NU and KEEP.

Stakers (whether T or legacy NU/KEEP that properly migrate) receive rewards in T
RapGamePatrickHenry		This post was very helpful ser but my IQ is too low to read the rest of the stuff on GitHub and I'm having trouble understanding how the protocol functions comprehensively. 

It looks like Keep/NuCypher nodes are still running, but will they convert themselves to Threshold nodes in the future? 
You said it's a modular staking contract, so does Threshold even require its own nodes? (again, low IQ, can't read code/know next to nothing in terms of technical blockchain basics so i apologize if this is a dumb question) 
Will the T tokens replace each of the functionalities that KEEP and NU perform? I.e., will keeps be maintained by Threshold nodes that stake T instead of KEEP? 
Will KEEP/NU nodes receive rewards in the legacy tokens and T as well?

Thank you so much for your help, I'm new to the space and still learning üôÇ

We want our channels full of Good mornings, meaningful conversation, and people who are looking to learn and  share their knowledge.
$RICH‚Ñ¢		I'm already in the marketing guild
MrsNuBooty		That‚Äôs awesome to hear!  We definitely have some community members doing their best to help us grow!  We have the Marketing Guild, Integrations Guild and a Treasury Guild.  Lots of things to dig in and lend a hand with now that you are here, start at the <#882289615959121990> channel.
$RICH‚Ñ¢		I seen your Twitter and I even follow you
$RICH‚Ñ¢		I've had keep for a while now.
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Thanks
MrsNuBooty		Welcome to the community
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Yea, I noticed that today. I was not in the community but because of that announcement I came to see what was going on.
MrsNuBooty		It is explained in the Binance article.  I don‚Äôt want to misquote the information so I‚Äôm just going to point you to the source -> https://twitter.com/thetnetwork/status/1491491991682748420?s=21
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Should I of removed my keep from binance or that was the best option?
$RICH‚Ñ¢		No
MrsNuBooty		Is it called the Threshold <#900823201045704784>?
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Anyways, do you know how long binance is gonna have my keep?
$RICH‚Ñ¢		I could. If you are interested I'm in a marketing group.
MrsNuBooty		Please take the lead <:dicapriolaugh:902179603001536512>
maclane		awesome <a:PepeSalute:745021416981659648>
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Ok I will. Thanks
$RICH‚Ñ¢		I didn't invest in doge or those meme tokens cause I believe in projects but the community drove those projects
maclane		ok, you're welcome to join the marketing guild and help with that üôÇ <#882289615959121990>
$RICH‚Ñ¢		No, it's called community engagement
maximo3453		Just noise
maclane		people do real work here, i guess. no time for chit chat
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Well. I see that hours pass by between messages. I'm in communities that are active
TheArtfulDodger		24 minutes is definitely a sufficient amount of time to judge community activity
maclane		ü•±
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Not good
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Community is not really engaged I see
maclane		probably will have a better idea of what this will look like going forward once T is listed on binance and there's more liquidity
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Cool. I own a nice bag of keep but wasn't In community
maclane		keep is now threshold so, yes, i suppose it is üôÇ
$RICH‚Ñ¢		This is too quiet
$RICH‚Ñ¢		Hey guys. Searching for keep community. Am I in the right place?
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		I got rusty once conversion went live ironically
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		These transparent response are super helpful
EDCAl		Question as well.  So as of rn   example my NU  is at 70k NU , valued at around 38.1k usd , if I convert 70k NU  to T  it will give me around  228k T token , that would be valued at 29k usd  with a increase of 3x in marketcap ,  so to change from NU  to T I have to loose  close to 10k and be  up 3x om marketcap ?
Ryan C		you can tune in here to the panel
Ryan C		https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver
willthesis		Happy to chat. Let us know if you have more q's. There is no deadline to convert b/c we didn't want to leave anyone behind. Also if you are new here check out our guilds by hitting <#882289615959121990>. It's a cool way to get involved with the DAO and buidl with us
EDCAl		Thank you  for answering,  by any chance is there a set date of when the  last day convert is ?
willthesis		Yes the token factor is static
EDCAl		Thank you , I know it's a tough question but it needs to be asked because I  have invested a pretty sizable investment ( relative to me  of course ) so question here as well I saw that the  number of T tokens  given per Nu will stay the same for a year or so ?  What if the price of Nu drops  , the   Nu   to T amount of token will still be the same correct , same goes if price goes up for just Nu?
willthesis		No worries it's a fair question. First, you get more T per NU upgraded. The token factor (upgrade ratio) is around 3.26 T per 1 NU. 

In terms of dilution the general thinking leading up to agreeing on / executing the merger in both communities was that in our case 1 + 1 > 2. Meaning more value for everyone is created as a result of combining networks than is lost in dilution.
EDCAl		So question here ,   what is the point of this in terms of people that held Nu at a current markercap  of around 379, when T current marketcap is around 1 billion ?  That's a huge dilution   for the risk taken for holding NU in terms of a low marketcap. Not trying to  come off as disrespectful or anything, just a legitimate  question in terms of what is the monetary value of this besides diluting  Nu holder bags  ans potential
willthesis		No immediate action is required but if you want to upgrade to T now you can do so on your own through the threshold dashboard https://dashboard.threshold.network/.
EDCAl		Question guys what does the merger mean for Nu holders on coinbase ?
khanny123		Buy keep on binance before tonight for automatic conversion
cryptofreelancer		thanks
jakelynch		no plans for that now
cryptofreelancer		Is it possible to buy T on Avalanche or some other chain to avoid ETH gas? Or any plan for that?
JP		Keep channel getting scam bombed?
MrsNuBooty		Twitter hangout link for tonight, we are starting now with <@!372997863061323788> and <@!526752265915203603>  - https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ZkKzbWeRvRKv
Xkoyopa		Any chance it will be recorded?
Xkoyopa		Werd!
maclane		Maybe someone has an agenda/schedule link
maclane		Friday 10am MT iirc
Xkoyopa		When will your discussion take place?
maclane		I will talk about PRE in the talk but it won't be PRE-specific, rather about Threshold as a whole
Beau		tytyty
xela7		Howdy - I am wondering if you know when there might be a talk about PRE at Eth Denver?
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		(super rough obviously; just wanted to get something down before any fog rolls in cuz that was a pretty intense discussion)
jMyles (NU Flute Guy)		Hey <@!98929788042887168> and <@!410212090289192960>, I opened this issue to memorialize at least some of our discussion in the suite today:

https://github.com/threshold-network/threshold/issues/3
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		patience is key, i been excited and reading every piece of news since last april üôÇ
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		for price discussion we can continue in <#870383905314832395>  but historically both coins had huge bumps each milestone as it got listed on exchanges like coinbase, a korean exchange and binance. so we will see similar project awareness and growth from Threshold as it gets listed more universally + adopted/converted to by users over the next few weeks. Will be an exciting spring!
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		this is a transitional phase so things will be funky until more folks convert + exchange convert helping to T + people clueless on threshold or keep or nucypher and just day trading etc + waiting for threshold to get listed on exchanges as well
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		<@!786066669704970250>  its also the first project of its kind to go through a merger like this its an exciting time
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		that would be arbitration yes but for long term investing it will balance out over time
maclane		https://giphy.com/gifs/a24-pqHRNTAQnbsaEju4Vb
maclane		Threshold is love, Threshold is life
maclane		NU and KEEP are T
maclane		no idea if they will still be listed on exchanges, we are not involved with that. seems most of the exchanges so far prefer to list only T to avoid splitting liquidity across 3 assets
Naxsun		If you're referring to MacLane's talk on the Wonderful world of threshold cryptography, that's on Friday the 18th.

You can sign up for the event in here and get notified through Discord when it starts
EDCAl		I see , so  essentially the vision is just T network ,  I'm other words NU and keep are done
MrsNuBooty		Keep and NuCypher team members now work on the Threshold Network.  The token to participate in staking and governance will be T.  NU and Keep held on exchanges will be subject to their terms for the upgrade.  We can not speculate on when CEXs will list or delist specific assets but the ultimate goal is for everyone who owns NU or KEEP to eventually choose to wrap so that they are able to participate in the Threshold Network.
EDCAl		I jusr re read your last message , so essentially , T can be looked as an addition and we could essentially keep our Nu tokens  as they will still be listed in exchnaged and have some type of value tied to the T network ? I'm not just not clear  if this is a shift of the project wanting to  move from keep and Nu to T and  over time. Keep and Nu be delisted  and gone etc and only T or is T something that can enhance the token Nu itself
MrsNuBooty		Correct - nfa but CEX listings usually cause great things with low liquidity.  Anything can happen from here!  If we want to keep speculating on price can we move it to <#870383905314832395>?
EDCAl		I see.  So right now , of course you're not giving me financial advice  ,but  the scenario here would essentially be, if I want to keep NU for a bit  gamble a bit if the monotery price appreciates  , if it does not , I will have that baseline safety net of 3.26 T per NU no matter what the Nu  price is
maclane		no worries üëç
maclane		We don't know the future of course, but I doubt the community, token holders, and stakers would have approved the merge if they thought it would be value destructive. Obviously, nothing is guaranteed but presumably in voting to approve the merge, they believed it would be value accretive
maclane		So a situation where T pumps and NU/KEEP dump doesn't really make sense - it'd be free money to buy NU/KEEP and wrap it to T
maclane		The way the upgrade works is that if T has value in the future NU and KEEP will as well since they can always be wrapped to T.
EDCAl		Thank you for your responses inknow I'm asking tough questions here , I greatly appreciate that you're answering them ,but I donhabe to.make this questions  because I've put in a considerable  amount of money in relation to my  current finances of course, so I thank you for responding
EDCAl		I see.  So that price of .12 is wrong then, that's what has been worrying me  because if I were to do that swap I'd loose a considerable amount to my situation of course ,  but a question as well I know of course you have no way of predicting price  ,but  would you say the swap will leave us at the point if swap  basically equal to our momotery value ? I just don't want to swap and loose money ,  if I could of just sold it,  also     the reason I'm worrying   is because of course the focus will be on the T token so I don't want to hold off  and Nu plummet  as  it's a dead token in terms  the team has left it behind for the T token
maclane		if you want to max paper value (or want to sell for max value) at this moment, then I agree it doesn't make sense to wrap
maclane		this is an artifact of low liquidity/low market depth while T bootstraps itself
maclane		but you don't have to upgrade now, if you prefer to wait for the prices to normalize that is 100% ok
maclane		yes, sure but (1) the CMC price is straight up wrong because it does not track the Curve pool and (2) again, no CEX listings so imo price extrapolations are meaningless until that changes
EDCAl		I get the face number of the price maybe right now doesn't matter ,but you do get what I'm trying to point out , just an example here  let's say I have 100k NU   at this current price it is  worth roughly 53k in usd at this momment , if my NU is converted to T , it's a 3.26 conversion rate  , it would net me approx 326k T tokens , the price right now  on T token   is  .12 cents according to coinmarkercap etc, that's a value of about  39k   so essentially with the price indication of .12 cents I'm loosing  about 14k in monotery value.
maclane		concentrating liquidity in one asset (T) vs splitting it across two assets (NU + KEEP) also has benefits in terms of market depth
maclane		i don't understand what you mean by 3x leverage
maclane		There's a good thread on the benefits/motivation here https://twitter.com/NuCypher/status/1478478558280527885?s=20&t=sUDMynarfjnLv8blAxR5Yw
maclane		T isn't listed on any CEXs at the moment, so imo the price is essentially meaningless until that changes
EDCAl		I'd greatly appreciate  if someone can chime in here  with a valid response. Ok I get the value proposition of 2 teams and networks joining  ,but it's all hopes and dreams, what is the benefit of loosing about 10k in terms of monetary value to convert Nu to T network when T is at a 1 billion marketcap , it's 3x less leverage since the marketcap is so much higher and we loose money by switching to T network , you guys give 3.26 Something for every NU and the price of T network is around 12 cents at 1 billion, if I change from NU to T my monetary value drops by 10k  how in the world does diluting our coins , bumping up the marketcap to 1 billion and loosing monetary value , benefit the holders ? Cansomeone explain to me how  this benefit Nu holders ?  I ask this as respectfully as I can be , I just want some explanations maybe I'm not aware of something else besides the promise that the project will be better but in terms of the coin structure and the switch can someone explain what the benefit is ?

BegYourPudding		It will eventually fade out. Think of it like an older piece of tech. Some people with support it, but that number will go down as more time passes and more people upgrade to the new tech: Threshold

ramaruro		Everything tied to WETH on Solana is now worth less or worthless (depends on how much WETH is available on Solana, but there is a shortage of collateral in 40K WETH here), so big domino effect on many protocols and users that had WETH

ramaruro		There was a hack on the Wormhole bridge from Ethereum to Solana, 80000 ETH (~210Million) stolen... Bridges are tough!!!
maximo3453		Any update of when nu stakers will be able to withdraw?
maclane		for threshold, the PolicyManager contract will be deployed on various L2s, starting with Matic
maclane		but it's not feasible to run on eth l1
maclane		with granting and revoking, yes. but not per access
Xkoyopa		Just thinking about the broader implication of eth/gas fees associated with utilization of T PRE and whether it could be a factor in hindering adoption of the tech.
Xkoyopa		Curious of T PRE, If a dApp utilizes T PRE, is there an eth(gas) fee associated with each transfer of encrypted data?
maclane		many other things i'm way more worried about
maclane		ok, well not too worried about that tbh
Charlemagne626		Wormhole got rekt
willthesis		You won't miss any rewards and the grace period isn't on pause. Not an exact eta but looks like it could be as early as today üôÇ
NateQ		Okay. Seems like almost a week already since it stopped. Does it mean the grace period is effectively on pause? Any ETA on when it will resume? Will rewards for the missed days be compensated after the top-up?
willthesis		They did not stop. Just a minor delay in the top up. The two week grace period is still in effect
maclane		<@!777913547095146538>

kudo94		Hey, yes, nu and keep teams remain independent, both tokens will continue to exist and develop
decaf		when withdrawing nu from my staker, is the eth for the gas fees coming from my worker address?
Doris		I wanna confirm if Nucypher as company is still independent. As per my understandingÔºåT is collaboration project with KeepÔºåbut Nu can still cooperate and contribute in other project. So if I perfer not change to TÔºåbut still use Nu for future stakingÔºåis it possibleÔºüThanksÔºÅ
SephirothY_y		any information about APY for T staking? I could not found on dashboard
damonC		cloudworkers is going to be like `nucypher cloudworkers deploy --migrate`
maclane		for nucypher/pre, yes
maclane		the contract implementation just allows it
tejaposh		I hope cloudworkers stays for pre installation right?
maclane		> but not sure there‚Äôd be much reason to do this
tejaposh		If i can reuse same stake for all services then what's the point to divide stake for services?
maclane		You can authorize different services to use a different amount of stake if desired (but not sure there‚Äôd be much reason to do this)
tejaposh		every service with same stake. Cool
maclane		so if you want max rewards, you probably run every service
tejaposh		I see
maclane		each service may have different rewards, slashing conditions, and node requirements
tejaposh		What's the advantage of staking in pre service but not for tbtc?? at the end of day we will be receiving rewards in T. Does those staking rewards vary for each service?
maclane		no, cov pool is a separate thing. it's not technically a staking app
maclane		you can reuse the same stake for each service
maclane		threshold was architected to easily allow the addition of future, undefined services. so hopefully never üôÇ and new ones keep coming
vivek		coverage pool 2 months too?
tejaposh		It seems i have to stake separately for each service? like 40kT for PRE, 40K T for tbtc etc.,
tejaposh		When can we expect all services to be up on Threshold for staking?
maclane		In the interim period immediately. In the steady state, once tbtc and other apps are up, each service will have their own unbonding time (will try to have them all be 2 months, unless some service has a special requirement)
tejaposh		How often the commitments are?
tejaposh		How soon i can unstake T? what's the minimum amount of time?
Tedi		Thank youüëçüèª
maclane		T is just the latest version of NU/KEEP
maclane		not abandoned, since you can always upgrade your NU to T
maclane		üëç  think of it like a software upgrade to you iPhone
Tedi		I am a long-term investor and I don't have much time to take an interest in project monitoring.  It was to know if Nu will be abandoned in favor of Treshold, that's my question.  thank you for your quick answers
maclane		Development continues
maclane		NU and KEEP become T
Tedi		I haven't followed the project recently.  Threshold is a fusion of Nu and Keep?  so there will be no more development on Nu or am I wrong?
maclane		If you want to stake and run a node you should upgrade, but if you‚Äôre just passively holding it doesn‚Äôt really matter
Tedi		but can I hold my Nu or do I have to swap?
maclane		So it‚Äôs not useless
maclane		No, as you wrote it became Threshold
Tedi		nu and keep became treshold?  Nu is useless now?
gedi		If I have keep on crypto.com exchange. What's easiest, safest, cheapest way to convert to T?
CryptoScam		Hopefully T staking will incentivize Keep and Nu holders to wrap
CryptoScam		thxs
willthesis		Yes council determined 40k min stake
CryptoScam		min stake is 40k right? so 10% APR
willthesis		yes but you can only unwrap the amount you wrapped
tejaposh		Keep to T and T to keep is possible right??
willthesis		min stake yields around 333 T per month rn
maclane		*Coinlist* can withdraw, end users withdrawals *from* Coinlist would need to be then enabled by them

CryptoScam		How much is the APR for T staking?

kin		Admin. Is there any reason that  keep eth apy is still high? I heard incentive is going to wind down
vivek		probably no coding involved. just use terminal commands
OverTh1nq		all incentives now come in T tokens? including operating node rewards?
bluebird		I can't write codeüòÜ
REZZ4NS		You'll need to run your own node
bluebird		Will the T team run official nodes which we can pledge it to . Or do we need to choose to pledge to another anonymous node ?
maclane		Stopped
OverTh1nq		Hey all - new here want to confirm some things. Were emissions of Nu/Keep stopped, or are those tokens still emitted?
laozhou		thanks
vivek		I don't know, depends on you üòõ
laozhou		will this be so hard for me?
vivek		You will need to run a node to stake initially
vivek		you need to wait then. Guide will be up soon
laozhou		not Lp sir
laozhou		i holy hold pure T governance token
vivek		you can LP on Curve right now. Staking is coming soon TM
laozhou		hello sir,my english is not good,i have some T tokens,can u teach me how to stke them
vivek		Should be very high when it does initially, but it is taking forever.
vivek		0, T staking has not been deployed.
DAM		whats current APR for staking? thanks
DAM		When T on Blockfolio?
maclane		40k T is the minimum stake
Brody		Will I need a certain amount of 'T' tokens before I'm able to run my own PRE node?
74v47		correct
pixel_21		sorry...late to the party here...so you can stake T right now but no rewards correct?
pscil		So what does staking with the current interface do?
Naxsun		Yes. Alternatively you could support the network and earn by doing so by adding funds to the coverage pool and/or provide liquidity
pscil		Does this mean we will have to r un a node for staking?
pscil		From the announcements "Staking T or migrating your legacy stake will allow you to participate in Threshold governance and to start earning inflation rewards later this month by running a PRE node once nucypher version 6.0 is released (additional node set up steps will be shared at that time, so stay tuned)."
vivek		Lots of tokens still exist but are not traded
vivek		Maybe on bilaxy and some trash exchanges. Even on AMMs you need someone to provide liquidity. Guess I can trade with urself
vivek		Nah it won‚Äôt lol
Bobooshka		NU is not gonna be delisted, it will trade for infinity. The only difference is you won't earn anything on NU because there is no staking rewards, only with T you will be able to earn.
Aulzon		what‚Äôs T apy
vivek		KEEP/NU staking will end in a few months and nobody will be holding KEEP/NU anymore. Exchanges will delist then imo. at the start all 3 might be listed.
Naxsun		Why would it be a mess? KEEP, NU and T will remain to co-exist forever.  The amount of T per KEEP and NU received from the vending machine will also remain the same. The expectation is that the majority of the KEEP and NU tokens will be locked in the vending machine and wrapped to T. There is also KEEP and NU that can't contractually be wrapped, and these can be staked on T through adapters. 

It's also an important principle of 'no token holder left behind'. The system is designed in such a way that if someone wants to wrap their KEEP or NU too T they still can. 

And in general, you can't 'stop' a token, and subsequently you can't stop it from being traded. I can imagine that CEXs decide to stop support trading at some point.
idgaf		from what I've read the idea is that gradually everyone will migrate to T... I guess when normie ppl holding nu/keep properly learn this like half will bother to migrate and half will probs just dump nu/keep idk
Naxsun		That's great feedback. Education is definitely an important priority for the DAO that we're forming. What is available now is listed there.  Main priorities now are T staking, PRE, tBTC v2, launch of the on chain DAO and further building out the DAO structure itself.

Definitely more to come, even better if you want to contributeüëçüèª Below explainer videos were made by Nous.

slava		If T gonna get to exchanges and both legacy tokens are still trading, that all would look like some mess. What‚Äôs about that? Maybe there is already such sort of discussion which I just missed?..
slava		Another thing I am not fully following is the future of the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù keep and NU networks/tokens.  I mean, yes, it‚Äôs clear that both team unite (sort of), however, what‚Äôs about the legacy networks from technical perspective like nodes, exchange trading etc.?
vivek		On the roadmap right now is staking (within days I assume), exchange listings (my guess this month) and tbtc 2.0 ( probably this quarter)
vivek		It is true
slava		Yeah. I did it. But as Ive mentioned, even the main webpage is kinda silent about the roadmap. Only general vision. Roadmaps are quite popular these days and provide strong understanding about the project perspective.
Naxsun		The timeline is there right?
Naxsun		I think <#892571186515566702> is the best place to start
vivek		I did, have you? It‚Äôs not really live yet and we can‚Äôt earn rewards
Naxsun		Check out the latest <#870384195636199455>
vivek		Any news on Nucypher v6? are we talking days or weeks till we can finally stake?
slava		Hello guys! Could you give me a hint, where I can find the network roadmap as well as it‚Äôs current state of development etc.? Couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere.
Hun_Zai		hello

vivek		Coinlist already said this month I think
vivek		There will never be an announced date on such things. That is how they just are, but as more people upgrade to T it becomes more likely. Should be this month imo.
Neptose		Thanks for the heads up, when is the listing in diferent exchanges roughly expected to start?
MrsNuBooty		With Threshold being community driven, someone in the community needs to request support for T on all of y‚Äôall‚Äôs favorite places.  I have filled out the Blockfolio request but y‚Äôall will need to go upvote it.  https://feedback.blockfolio.com/coin-requests/p/httpsthresholdnetwork
DAM		When T on Blockfolio?
gedi		What is max supply of T?
vivek		yes, people will arb once it is listed on coinbase or binance and the value will be "tied" more closely
Neptose		I see that the Threshold Network's native token T still has no data in CMC, how is the market value of this token going to be calculated initially? And how will this token's value vary and fluctuate with regard to the value of NU and KEEP? Are the Marketcaps of these 3 assets tied together or how will it work initially?
vivek		it's still best if you sell NU and buy KEEP then upgrade KEEP to T as you get 40% more T per KEEP
vivek		you can upgrade right now.
vivek		https://dashboard.threshold.network/upgrade/nu
vivek		short term: you help us get listed on coinbase and binance. long term: you just have to as keep/nu will have no staking or use
Neptose		When, where and how can I exchange my NU for T? If I have my NU in a CEX. And what are the short and long term benefits?
Naxsun		It's fixed indeed. They are contract parameters of the vending machine
SlackerFatChoy		So the exchange rate of 1 NU for 3.26 T and 1 KEEP for 4.78 T. Is this exchange rate the same forever? No matter the price of NU , KEEP and T?
I have a lot of NU stuck in coinlist till the end of feb, and I worried if the exchange rate isn‚Äôt fixed

damonC		But it (worklock) is basically a wonderful yet distant memory
damonC		The StakingEscrow contract still contains the code needed for anyone who still has ETH locked in Worklock.  It should be withdrawable.
[UO Outlands] Arch Lich Oro		Koinly is popular
slow_and_steady		What about the remaining work lock? Does the contract require it?
maclane		I think we don't have a UI option for withdrawing ETH at the moment, is that right <@!139551375825567744> <@!412679128316379137>? But you can withdraw directly from the contract on e.g. etherscan
slow_and_steady		Yes
maclane		üëã since you're referring to bonded ETH, I'm assuming this is a WorkLock stake?
slow_and_steady		Before the upgrade to the network I still had 3 months left to stake in order to receive my bonded ETH. I see the above addresses bonded NU but how do I get back my ETH?
Angalina | Coin Tiger		Thankyou sir

Eskimo		Admin, answer
!Mason		<@!405654833131945984>
jeffrky		Could anyone explain to me how to get the number of my previous transaction in unit256
maclane		in the interim period when it's just a PRE node, no. but ultimately, yes, there will be slashing once all the applications (i.e. tbtc, etc.) are launched
Eskimo		I had tokens in a staking on coinlist, But now there is no tab of this and there are no coins on the wallet.
eazye		When running a node, is there any kind of slashing penalty that happens if there is downtime?
jeffrky		If I wrapped KEEP using InfinityWallet which does not have a mobile version is there still a way to unwrap back to KEEP?
Di9		I have a question. I have some NU on coinlist wallet. What do I need to do?
maclane		you can reuse your stake for multiple services
Sammy675		I have a question. Has it been decided yet if 40000t to run a node can run all services. Reason I ask is let‚Äôs say I set up a pre node and I put 100000 T to run it. If  I want to run other services would I have to stake another 40000 and run another node.
NuLypheStyle		https://interim-pre-application-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Sammy675		Is there a guide to set up T staking
willthesis		Let us know if you have questions. You can also work with a staking provider
REZZ4NS		Seems a little daunting but I'll spend some time to figure out T staking thanks
willthesis		That is up to you! T staking is live now just giving everyone time to set up nodes before rewards start
REZZ4NS		Is it worth using keep coverage pools while waiting for T staking?
willthesis		We don't actively seek exchange listings because the decision is not up to us
bubbleoseven		T already on Hotbit
greenknight15		Any updates from the team on if exchanges will support T at any point? 

There seems to be a bit of a first mover problem going on (me included). 1. people with NU see KEEP and want to trade to KEEP before T (which I don‚Äôt think is a big deal but people continue to mention it).  2. People see their NU is more valuable as NU than it would be with the trade out to T. 

I think if T could get listed this might fix both problems.  

Thank you.
ghard1314		Also its just a demo so please be gentle lol. Works best on desktop. Shoot me a DM if anything breaks!
ghard1314		Hi all! Finally coming out of my cave with something to show! Just launched a demo of the first (soon-to-be) fully decentralized encrypted NFT protocol powered by Threshold. It is backwards compatible with all existing NFT standards. We use the current PRE service and will soonn incorporate the upcoming AbioticAlice DKG service when available. Would love for you to check it out and give some feedback!

https://opendrm-client.dev.masterfile.co/
maclane		It aslo has governance functions re: participation in the Threshold DAO
maclane		The token itself is a work token that's used to stake and run nodes on the Threshold network. These nodes provide threshold cryptography services (proxy re-encryption, threshold signatures, distributed key generation, etc.) that can be used to provide data privacy/access controls as well as power cross-chain bridges (i.e. TBTC a decentralized version of wrapped BTC)
willthesis		Check out the merge FAQ doc in <#892571186515566702>. The token split is straight forward - 45% to keep holders, 45% to nu holder, 10% to the DAO with inflation all of which was determined by the community during the merger process. 

There is flexibility for what the DAO can use its treasury for. We have been working on alignment on a budget which explains this in more detail. 

Outside of liquidity incentives, the DAO is looking at - token swaps to diversify the treasury, paying contributors, funding community projects such as threshold USD and a lot more.
willthesis		Welcome üëã
chronology		Is there anywhere the tokenomics of T are explained?  Read about the merger - but not sure I understand how the T token will be used, other than liquidity incentives
chronology		Seems like a privacy tool for Ethereum smart contracts?
chronology		Found T as a result of the recent bribe for CVX gauge voters.  Trying to understand what threshhold is...
willthesis		Rewards don't start until later this month as per <#870384195636199455>
willthesis		As of now you need to transfer and wrap your own tokens. There could be full exchange support in the future. There is no deadline to upgrade into to T
vamsi2016		What happens to Keep/NU tokens on CEX's , do we need to transfer and convert or exchanges will support ? Also by when we need to convert to Threshold token

Mint.		Can someone point me to a resource to explain why there's this keep nu threshold exchange
Boster		ya there's a guide in "market" channel - but requires using etherscan
BarZaTTacKs		Problem is there's no clear way of how to do that easily
Elon Huang		NU and KEEP will be out of circulatio, i guess the best way is swap NU to KEEP then wrap KEEP to T
Boster		haha possible
Elon Huang		cauz smart money is in the minorityÔºü
taking notes		Is NU and KEEP going to be worthless? We have to convert ? I've been holding my NU and KEEP on coinbase,  is it best to just sell now ?
Elon Huang		U need call smart contract to convert, so.....
dimpy		Can any1 tell me ??
dimpy		?????
Jdee		See I only have metamask and my NU on coinlist so new to all of this
vonsete		good morning from spain
dimpy		Hey when i connect my wallet  to convert my keep into t will there be any gas fee?
Boster		i'm giving free alpha, but if you wrapped NU to T before, you actually should unwrap it back to NU, sell it to KEEP, then wrap to T again
Isin		there is KEEP-NU pool on Uniswap
Boster		i think deposit is open
Jdee		Is there any way to convert NU to keep outside of binance or better to wait?
Boster		ya fair
yumyumdimsum		not sure but i would guess no.. because whatever you wrap can only be unwrapped back to that same asset. that asset is basically sitting in reserve as a 1:1 peg to what you wrapped for. otherwise if everyone wrapped keep and unwrapped to NU, there wouldn't be enough NU to give to them
Boster		i would gain 20% extra Keep
Boster		to be honest i'm wondering...is it possible to use Keep to wrap to T, unwrap to Nu, then convert back to Keep?
yumyumdimsum		yea i'm going to be doing this.. makes more sense at current prices
Boster		actually it works now
Jdee		
Jdee		Nucypher deposits not available on binance apparently
Boster		i think the smart thing to do is to sell NU for Keep on binance, then exchange it to T
Jdee		Hey guys, so coinlist have finally released my NU, can anyone link me to a guide as to what to do next?
Boster		why doesn't everyone just swap NU for Keep right now?  if you do that you get a 20% discount
Matt Luongo		There's not a cap. The 9B are split between the two networks, 1B goes to the treasury, then there's staking inflation.
tony-tang		<@!405654833131945984>
tony-tang		Is there a cap on the maximum total amount of T tokens? Will the initial number of tokens in circulation be 9 billion?
yumyumdimsum		gotcha.. thank you!
maclane		afaik, binance will be using the smart contract to do the upgrade
yumyumdimsum		oh it's the same rate via smart contract as the rate on binance?
maclane		
yumyumdimsum		hey guys! i prefer not to leave my KEEP and NU on the exchange. what's the exchange rate to T tokens if I wrap them through the smart contract instead?
Matt Luongo		sounds fake. We occasionally make small sales, but typically stick with VCs and locked up OTC ‚Äî open market is for stuff like funding the tBTC relay, which shouldn't have a big impact
acis		Acclrding to altcoinsmacro, team of keep is sellling tokens and this is the reason why gap us no filled. Fake?
tejaposh		Circulating supply? Like how much is converted so far and how much is left?
tejaposh		Does anybody know the market cap of threshold?
acis		Dont make sense with nu at 0.6 that keep no go to 0.9
Xkoyopa		1 Nu = 3.26 T
1 Keep = 4.78
greenknight15		Can someone pass along the exchange rates for T for NU vs KEEP again.  Had a plan for what I wanted to do, then prices moved and want to make sure what I am doing still makes sense for myself.
Xkoyopa		My guess is when staking rewards become active Coinbase will list T/support wrapping process (however, I am just a lowly ignorant pleb)
Mic		cool, and others? KEEP and Nu have so many big venture capitalists.
Xkoyopa		Well, Bison Trails operates Nu Nodes, and will be running T nodes...
Coinbase acquired Bison Trails...
They will most certainly be part of T
Mic		sorry one last question, KEEP has alot of big venture capitalists like a16z portfolio, coinbase ventures, polychain capital, etc. Are they all going to be part of T? Or they part ways?
Xkoyopa		Not available yet, end of the month
innov8ion		Is T available on Binance US or just Global?
Mic		it
